# Design Intent
Did the CMS team recommend a Design Intent in your CMS Collaboration Cycle Request ticket? If so, follow the below guidelines to get started.

## Owner
CMS Team

## Timing
Request this touchpoint when you have an idea of how to solve the problem statement provided in your Product Outline and have at minimum drafted a lo-fi prototype and/or wireframe.

Design Intent meetings require a 2 day lead time before a meeting is held. This is required in order to allow enough time for a Designer on the CMS team to review your artifacts and prepare their feedback for your team.

## Format
Synchronous 30-minute meeting

## Meeting request
Insert info here about how we want teams to schedule their Design Intent meeting with the CMS Team.

## Agenda
This is the first opportunity for the CMS Team to view your product and the proposed solution to your problem statement provided as part of your Product Outline. You’ll introduce your new work initiative and discuss existing solutions in the problem space. You’ll present your wireframe/prototype and walk through the user flow.

The CMS team will then ask questions and provide feedback relevant to the product.

## Objective
For your team to get feedback on the user experience and your product’s overall design.

After reading over the Product Outline provided by your team, the CMS Team uses this meeting to gain a deeper understanding of your product/feature, including the goals/direction of the product, the intended user flow, and the overall scope of the initiative.

## Moderator script
Each Design Intent meeting begins with the CMS Team moderator reading the moderator script.

This script ensures that everyone participating in the meeting and everyone watching the recording after the meeting understands why the meeting takes place, how it will proceed, and how teams should expect to receive feedback from the CMS Team.

**The script reads as follows:**
"Welcome to the Design Intent for _______ team for ______ initiative.

The Design Intent meeting is intended to be a collaboration touchpoint between teams building on the Drupal content management system and the CMS Platform Team. We ask that you first introduce your new work initiative to us and discuss the problem space you are trying to solve for. It’s helpful to learn of any constraints you were facing. Then, present your design artifacts and walk us through the user flow. Please limit your presentation on your work initiative and artifacts to 10 minutes to ensure reviewers have enough time to provide feedback. I will give you a one-minute warning. Next, any CMS Team reviewers on the Zoom will ask questions and provide feedback relevant to the product. We will help guide you to existing design components, research findings, and share relevant examples from other CMS work. We will also communicate any information to ensure you’re building a product that meets CMS Platform Team standards. Feedback will be given in a Must/Should/Consider format. Please note that "Must" feedback, if not addressed, could result in launch-blocking issues. By not addressing the "Must" feedback, your team accepts the risk of being blocked from launch to the Drupal CMS Platform. Please handle accordingly."
