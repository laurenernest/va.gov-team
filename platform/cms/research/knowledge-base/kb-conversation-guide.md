# Conversation Guide for Understanding CMS Editors’ Knowledge Base Needs 
VFS-CMS December 2023
## Moderator logistics
* Mute your Slack notifications
* Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
* Make sure notetakers and observers have access to Mural board (or wherever group feedback will be collected)
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.

## Intro - 3 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Joann and I have some colleagues with me who will be observing and taking notes. I'm going to ask them to wave hello and then they will turn off their cameras to limit distractions while we talk. Today, we're going to focus on the CMS Knowledge Base. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take about one hour. I want to be sure not to keep you longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* We can stop the session at any time. If you want to stop, just let me know.
* There will come a point where sharing your screen will be helpful. Feel free to prepare by closing any tabs or windows you’d like to keep private. 
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. When we present our research none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
* Start recording.
  * I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Before we look at the Knowledge Base, I'd like to learn a little more about you and your work.
* Can you tell me a bit about your role?
  * What generally makes up your workday?
  * What aspects of your work do you find most fulfilling or enjoyable? 
  * What percentage of your work is with the CMS?
* When you have a question regarding your work within the CMS, where do you go to find an answer (e.g., slack, coworker, KB, helpdesk…), and why is that your preferred source of information?	
  * Do you ever use the KB to find answers? Why or why not? [Note, remember answer for Second Task]
  * How do you find out about changes to the CMS, like a new feature or an upgrade, for example? 
  * How do you usually deal with things changing in the CMS or other tools you use? Were there times when it felt a bit tricky to get used to something new? 
 * Beyond the CMS, how comfortable are you using digital tools in your work? 
  * Do you find it easy to pick up new technology?
  * What’s your general attitude toward incorporating new tech into your workflow?

## First Task: Open card sort - 20 minutes
* I’m going to drop a link in the chat to the first activity. Once you open it, can you begin screen sharing with me so I can follow along with what you're doing?
  * _[Note: If they are unable to open the link, I will share my screen and have them direct me instead]_
* Instructions
  * In this exercise, you'll review a list of article titles that represent topics covered in the Knowledge Base. You'll then group those titles in a way that makes the most sense to you and then give each of your groups a title.
  * There are no wrong answers; there is no “right” way to complete this activity. Remember, you are not being tested. Whatever you come up with will help us better understand how people think of and relate to the different topics and sections within the KB. This will help us rethink how we present the KB and its content to all users of the CMS.
  * Any cards that are confusing or you’re unsure about, you can put them to the side and come back to them. 
* So, to start, take some time to digest the cards in front of you. You don’t have to start moving anything just yet. Just get a lay of the land. 
* Once you feel comfortable, you can begin to move things around. It’s important to talk out loud during this so I can hear your thought process. I will also prompt you along the way. So, start grouping and naming whenever you feel ready. 
* [As they work, pop in with questions about what they’re thinking and doing, if they aren’t explaining themselves out loud]
* [After they finish] Talk me through what you’ve put together. As you explain, know that nothing is set in stone. You can regroup and rename as you get more familiar with the material. 
* Wrap up questions
  * Are you happy with the end result? Why or why not? 
  * Which cards were the most challenging to place and/or name? 

## Second task: General KB exploration - 15 minutes
* Now we’re going to look at the CMS Knowledge Base. 
* When was the last time you accessed the KB? 
  * What were you looking for, and were you able to find it to your satisfaction?
* Can you navigate to the CMS Knowledge Base? [Allow time to find it and log in]
  *  _[Note: If they are unable to log into the KB, I will share my screen instead]_
  * What did you think of the process to get here? 
* Now that you’re here, I’d like to get your thoughts on what you’re seeing. Without clicking anything, what are your impressions of this page? 
* How would you describe the organization of the KB? Are things currently laid out in a way that makes sense to you? 
  * What is your ideal way to have KB articles organized to make things easier for you in your role? 
  * In your daily tasks, are there specific topics or areas that you feel are particularly crucial to have quick access to within the KB? 
  * Can you describe any challenges you currently face in finding information related to your responsibilities within the KB?
  * In your opinion, how important is it for the KB to reflect the distinct needs of different editor roles across various facility types (VAMC, VC…)
* How do you feel about the language used (for example, do you know what a “product guide” is)?
* Based on what you see here, what topic, if any, would you be most inclined to read more about?  
* In your opinion, is there anything missing from this page? What would you want to know that isn’t here? 

## Third Task: Find [X] article - 10 minutes
* _This task is based on their answer to the last question of the previous section. If they did not provide one, ask them to find information about content release._ 
* What would you do to find information about [____]?
  * Whether they search or browse: How satisfied are you with how easily you were able to find that information? (1=not at all, 5=totally)
* Can you think of another topic you would like to learn more about? Once you think of something, try using the search function to find it. 
  * How do you feel about the results presented to you?
  * Which result are you inclined to click? Why?
  * Does the result give you enough information to determine whether this is relevant to you? If not, what info is missing?

## Thank you and closing - 2 minutes
We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is enormously helpful as we continue to make improvements to the KB.


Thank you again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
