# Voice & tone
By consistently practicing language in an intentional way, we can provide content that supports the editor's needs and improve their experience in the Drupal CMS. Our goal is to help you create consistent, clear, and customer-centered content. Content should follow [plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/). 

### We define better content as:

- **Consistent**. We use words consistently to inspire trust and confidence in our editors.
- **Conversational.** We use everyday human words and plain language whenever possible. We talk like a human, not like Government.
- **Clear and helpful.** We present complex information in simple, bite-sized chunks at the point of need.
- **Empathetic.** We talk person-to-person with our editors, and [use person-first language.](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content#1-put-the-person-before-their-condition)

### Our voice in the Drupal CMS should:
- **Be actionable.** We clearly state what action our editors should take when filling out a field or correcting an error.
- **Use pronouns.** Use "we" and "you" pronouns. Use we/us/our when referring to the Drupal CMS team or Help desk. Use you/your when addressing editors and other audiences.
- **Identify the Drupal CMS consistently.** When speaking about or for the Drupal CMS, say “Drupal CMS” or “the system.”
