# Accessibility on VA.gov
- [x] We strive to make VA.gov accessible, beyond compliance.
- [x] We aim to do more than pass a Section 508 audit.
- [x] We integrate accessibility practices across research, design, and development disciplines, starting as early in the product cycle as possible.

## Strategy and Standards
- Learn more about our [accessibility strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy).
- Find out what [experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards) a VA.gov product needs to meet before it launches.
- The [accessibility defect severity rubric](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-defect-severity-rubric) is our common language for determining the seriousness of an accessibility issue.

## A11y Support and Validation

### Choose Your Path to Accessibility

**There are two routes to access support from accessibility specialists:**
1. Teams can travel through the Collaboration Cycle lane, or
2. Teams can take the scenic route and seek out general accessibility support beyond the Collaboration Cycle

‚ö†Ô∏è**Note**: Any ticket(s) given, on either route, will drive your team towards a more accessible product.

### What is the difference between Governance and CAIA? 

Sitewide CAIA partners with the VFS team early on and throughout the product lifecycle process to provide them with the information, guidance, and resources needed to build exceptional veteran-facing products.

- **Governance**: Advisory Role
- **CAIA**: Project Support Role

<details><summary>Toggle to view the details for each accessibility route available to your team</summary>

### Route 1: Collaboration Cycle
The Collaboration Cycle, managed by the **Platform Governance** team, is where teams who are building products/features on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards for design, content, information architecture, quality assurance, accessibility, and research. Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their product‚Äôs/feature‚Äôs lifecycle via three separate touchpoint meetings (Design Intent, Midpoint Review and Staging).
