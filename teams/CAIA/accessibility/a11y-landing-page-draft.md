# Accessibility Landing Page

<details><summary>Toggle to view details about this Work in Progress Landing Page</summary>
  <br>
The goal of this page is to provide a well-organized clearinghouse of information about VA's accessibility practices. Our mission - to point VFS teams to the information, tools, and people they need to make VA.gov accessible, beyond compliance.

## About this page
The structure and content of this page is based on:
- [CAIA's documentation content inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YsMFmvgD4hEc93KTaTPJwvR5heHsCNgC3cwj53Eu3Ys/edit#gid=737007164)

# Accessibility on VA.gov
VA is here to serve American Veterans, and [approximately 40% of of them have an identified disability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/disability-statistics-veterans.md). Therefore:
- We strive to make VA.gov as accessible for Veterans as possible.
- We aim to do more than pass a Section 508 audit - we focus on usability, not just compliance.
- We "shift left," integrating accessibility practices across research, design, and development disciplines, starting as early in the product cycle as possible.


## Strategy and standards
- Learn more about our [accessibility strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy).
- Find out what [experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards) a VA.gov product needs to meet before it launches.
- The [accessibility defect severity rubric](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-defect-severity-rubric) is our common language for determining the seriousness of an accessibility issue.

We aim to follow [inclusive design best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/learning-sessions/abc01-inclusive-design-best-practices
) in all of our work.

## Accessibility by discipline
All of us are responsible for the accessibility of our products. And every discipline has a role:

## Get help from accessibility specialists


There are two routes to access support from accessibility specialists:
1. During the Collaboration Cycle, from the Governance team
2. At any point in your product's lifecycle, from CAIA and other accessibility specialists


### Route 1: Collaboration Cycle support from Governance
Teams **creating new features or products** are required to go through the Collaboration Cycle, which includes accessibility reviews. The Collaboration Cycle is managed by the Governance team.
<details><summary>Learn about the Collaboration Cycle</summary>


 <br>The Collaboration Cycle, managed by the **Platform Governance** team, is where teams who are building products/features on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards for design, content, information architecture, quality assurance, accessibility, and research. 
 
Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their product‚Äôs/feature‚Äôs lifecycle via three separate touchpoint meetings (Design Intent, Midpoint Review and Staging).

[Learn how the Collaboration Cycle works](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/), and [contact the Governance team](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/contact-us) with your questions.

### Route 2: General accessiblity support from CAIA
