# Debt Portal Medallia Feedback (draft, in progress)

## **Summary and opening:**

156 Veterans left qualitative feedback on the debt portal pages in December of 2023, and January of 2024. The majority of challenges described include 

**1. The inability to retrieve debt letters,** 

**2. Missing information such as copay bill details and account number retrieval making paying the bill or the debt challenging, and**
 
**3.  Payment update discrepancy (an issue described in previous reports).**

The following quote encapsulates the difficulty of making smart financial decisions without accurate information, highlighting the importance of timely and coherent financial information being communicated across the different channels (on the debt portal, in the mail, and by phone/live support).

> "View debt, view payment history and see what debt is remaining. This
> application has not been updated since 2019. This is a problem for
> veterans. How can we budget and make smart financial decisions without
> accurate information." (Veteran response to *'what task were you trying
> to do today?*', January 2024)

The Debt Resolution team is currently implementing new copy on the debt portal to inform Veterans that payments made may not be reflected immediately, which will alleviate worry and concerns. The team will also be implementing a payment history feature this year.


## **Tasks described by Veterans:**

-   Check debt status
-   Make a payment
-   See details of copay charges
-   See details of compensation related debt
-   Find account number
-   Dispute a debt
-   Paying recurring copays

## **Top issues:**

- Difficulty retrieving debt letters

> I was told I was in debt to the VA but was unable to pull up the debt
> letter(s). I suspect the reason was my Wife died in October and they
> overpaid me a couple months. Not a good way to do business.
> Interesting that the VA is so quick in recovering the few dollars they
> overpaid me, but they have been [expletive] around with my request to
> have my disability reevaluated for almost a year. I would say the
> priorities are wrong. (January 2024)
> 
> I was trying to download my VA debt letters, but they were
> unavailable. The letters are never available and haven't been for the
> past 6 years. Fix this. (January 2024)
> 
> See my debt letters. I have not been able to access these letters, and
> the VA continues to assert debts, despite already having been paid
> over $22,144. (December 2023)

-   Difficulty making a payment due to missing information (details of bill or account number findability challenges)

*Bill details missing:*

> Pay my co-pay. I never received a bill, so I have none of the
> information needed to pay. All I got was a notice. (December 2023)
> 
> Got a message saying I owe money, signed in to pay online, and all my
> account information on bill was missing (December 2023)

*Account number retrieval difficulty:*

> I owe $400 to you due to an overpayment. I do not have any problem
> giving you this money but your payment system is so [expletive]
> retarted I can not pay it online. I am currently overseas on a
> deployment and am out during your business hours so I have not been
> able to call. All I want to do is provide you my [expletive] credit
> card number and have you guys bill that like every other website where
> I pay someone. But here I need my hard copy bills to give you a
> [expletive] number that you already have. Problem is, the bills are
> not available online, so send it to collections and let me get a
> credit score hit over $400 because the VA website is the worst.
> (January 2024)

 *  Payment not updated

> I was trying to see if my November payment has reached you yet. My Dec
> statement still shows owing $29. My bank shows this payment has been
> received my VA. I tried several phone calls and either was
> disconnected or as in the last case on hold for over 10 minutes.
> (December 2023)
> 
> Checking VA Statement. The amount that is showing due was paid 30 days
> ago. It would be much better if the amount due was updated sooner. It
> can also be difficult and time consuming to navigate to the this page
> that shows VA monthly statements. (December 2023)

  * A need to see copay charge details (need: dispute copay charges)

> Review my prescription co-pay. It would help if I could see the copy
> of my bill as I need to dispute the charges. I'll just wait for the
> bill to come in the mail. (December 2023)
> 
> There was a CO-PAY listed due for 39.00. It was the same amount as
> last month. I think your records are not up to date. The bill should
> at least note what I am being charged for. (December 2023)

   A need to see compensation-related debt accounting details

> Review the details of my compensation-related debt. i can see the
> total debt, but cannot see the accounting of how that debt was
> calculated. This is a basic service all financial institutions and
> creditors provide. (December 2023)
> 
> I was trying to view my current debt payment plan but there is no
> option to see that. It would be 100% beneficial to all veterans if we
> were able to view all details and not just letters. the letters do not
> have the current information I'm seeking. the main page only shows the
> amount owed. (December 2023)
> 
> There is insufficient detail to make a reasoned decision as to whether
> or not to pay this bill! (December 2023)
