# Product Outline Accredited Rep Facing

---

## Overview
We will create a site for accredited representatives hosted on va.gov yet visually distinct where VSOs are able to accept or reject representation requests from form 2122.

## Problem Statement
The current systems for accepting or denying representation requests by form 2122 are either hosted on a deprecated site, or are entirely on paper. It is very slow and doesn't contain a method for notifying the Veteran if the request has been accepted or rejected.

HOw might we digitize the 2122 and host it on a more modern site.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

The site is easy to use
The site increases the number of claims accepted or rejected digitally
Representative begin to use and trust the site
Representives are able to immediately start working on a Veteran's needs as soon as they accept the representation request.

## Undesired User Outcomes
Representatives find the site too confusing or ineffiencent

## Desired Business Outcomes
Increased use of digital forms which is a current OCTO priority
Decrease in forms that are unanswered or unresponded to

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Representatices are unwilling to use the site, even as it expands into other uses
