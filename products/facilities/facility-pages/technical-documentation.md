# Facility Pages

Facility pages encompass Vet Centers, VAMC Systems and Facilities, VBA, etc., or all facility pages that are generated on content-build from drupal data. 
These pages are changed by editors at different levels, but the resulting content is processed by content-build or next-build. 

# Testing
Testing of these pages is difficult, due to the potentially changing nature of the data. From one day to the next, a facility may be closed and inaccessible, 
and should that happen, testing that may include that site is complicated.
