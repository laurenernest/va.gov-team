*** Important: research plan currently in draft form ***

This research plan is on pause while the Facilities team prioritizes another product launch. Some sections have not been updated from the boilerplate content, and others will need to be updated when the project resumes. These are a few key considerations for when work resumes on the plan:
- Revisit recruitment criteria and segmented cohort approach. Based on upcoming research with assistive tech users on Public Websites, we may want to update our strategy to maximize the potential of recruiting Veterans who use AT.
- Complete the sections after the recruitment section

# Research Plan for Facility locator mobile map

## Background

[Facility locator product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/product/facility-locator-product-outline.md)

Veterans use the Facility Locator as the single source of truth on VA.gov to find physical locations where they can receive benefits and services. Veterans expect relevant and meaningful search results presented in a clear and actionable format. Veterans using assistive technology (AT) expect FL to deliver results in a format that they can navigate with ease.

Where is your product situated on VA.gov? 

Unauthenticated

What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

- Iteration on existing product. 
- Heavily used by Veterans, caregivers, general public

### OCTO Priorities 
Which OCTO priorities does this research support? 

- Enhance accessibility, reliability, and security of Veteran's digital services
- Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find, use, and receive services

**Increase**
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

**Decrease**
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran Journey?

The Facility locator tool assists Veterans at every step of their journey, from Starting up to Aging and Dying. 

## Research Goals	

### Outcome
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on enhancements to the facility locator map feature, especially accessibility improvements.

Additionally, we are testing the USWDS segmented button group component.

### Research questions

**From existing search page**

What do sighted Veterans and Veterans using AT expect from the location mapping tool?
- Do they interact with the map before trying to search?
- Are instructions for improving search results clear?
- How do they navigate search results if they want to learn about multiple locations?
- Do they know what to do when expected results are not returned or when no there are no results?

**From the map prototype in staging**

Do sighted Veterans and Veterans using AT understand the distinction between map and list view?  
- Do they understand how to toggle between the two views?
- Is the numbering of search results clear?
- Do they understand what will happen if they select a numbered result on the map?
- Do they understand that interacting with the map directly will alter the list of results in list view?

Do sighted Veterans and Veterans using AT understand how to refine and alter map view?  Do they use the zoom functionality? How do AT users interact with zoom?
- Do they use "Use my location" feature?
- Do they notice and/or select numbered results on the map? 
- What do they expect will happen when they do?

Do sighted Veterans and Veterans using AT find the location-specific informationrelevant and actionable?  
- Can they identify which facilities are closest to their desired location?
- Do they know which phone number to call for general information?
- Do they understand the purpose of each phone number listed?
- Is there any relevant information they expect to see that isn't there? (URL, site hours, etc)

### Hypothesis
Veterans, including Veterans who use assistive technology, will understand:
- How the list of results are organized and what options they have to refine or broaden their results
- How tointeract with the map and how their interactions change the search results
- The difference between map view and list view, and how to move from one to the other
- Which fields are required or optional for conducting a search
- How to take the next action after picking their desired location (click on website, call, get directions etc)

## Methodology	
We will conduct usability testing to guide research participants through a coded prototype. We'd like half of the participants to be on mobile devices. We'd like half of the participants to be screen reader users. Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would likeZoom transcripts please.

### Research materials
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment. Link to conversation guide- [Link to prototype](url goes here)

### Location
Remote, via Zoom
  
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

The target audience for our research is Veterans and their caregivers with an emphasis on screen reader users. We will use a segmented cohort approach.

### Recruitment criteria
Our research participants will be veterans and their caregivers, and we will use Perigean to recruit Veterans and caregivers for this moderated study. We’d like to recruit 12 participants for a total of 8 completed sessions:

Cohort 1: Sighted users who are NOT screen reader usersrecruit 6, complete 4
[link to]recruitment request ticket forCohort 1

Cohort 2: Screen reader users  recruit 7, complete 4 (prefer to have at least one mobile user)
[link to]recruitment request ticket forCohort 2

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

Inclusive representation: 
- 4 people who use screen readers
- 4 people who are 55+
- 3 people with identify as having a cognitive consideration
- 4 people must be family members or caregivers

Additionally, all participants:  
- Must be veterans or caregivers
- Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
- Must be willing to share a web browser window on the Zoom call
- Must have a working microphone
- Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer or mobile phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 90 minutes for AT users, 60 minutes for non-AT users
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
