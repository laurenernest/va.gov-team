*** Important: conversation guide currently in draft form ***

This research is on pause while the Facilities team prioritizes another product launch. Some sections have not been updated from the boilerplate content, and others will need to be updated when the project resumes. These are a few key considerations for when work resumes on the guide:
- Revisit tasks based on prototype. The guide is based on map functionality currently on [Facilities Locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/). There are still some unknowns about what the final prototype will look like and how it will function.
- Revisit set-up prompts and wording of tasks with an eye toward instructive and inclusive language for assistive technology users. Sitewide

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- Today we’re going to talk about the location fnding tool on VA.gov. We'll be mostly focused on search results on the
map. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This **entire session should take about [60] [90] minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may
occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing
your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you
express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don’t want to.
- Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefts with the VA in any way. If you would like to
stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that’s no problem. Please let me
know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe
this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of
additional observers joining this session?
> If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

> If yes: Admit observers.

[Ask the notetaker and observers to briefy turn their camera on and introduce them by name.
Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session]

For part of this session, you’ll be interacting with a prototype. That means that even though it will look exactly
like a regular website, some areas of the screen may not work as you expect them to. Since it's not a live website,
nothing you do on the screen will affect your VA information or benefts.

I'd like to record my screen and audio today to make sure we capture your thoughts and experiences
accurately. After we're done analyzing your insights about our prototype, the recordings will be destroyed, and
nothing you say here will be directly linked to you. If we want to quote something you say directly, we will refer to
you only by a participant number. We'll also remove any part of your comments that could be used to directly
identify you. 

Knowing all of this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand
Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share fndings with our partners across the VA is by showing
short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly
be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our
partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips
will not be shared outside of the VA. We don’t know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time.
At the end of the interview, I’ll also confrm this with you at the end, so you will have the opportunity to change
your mind.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our
partners understand Veteran’s experiences?

> If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
