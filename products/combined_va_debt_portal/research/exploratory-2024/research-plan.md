# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Exploratory and Concept Study, Roadmap and debt portal IA, February 2024

## Background

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

-   What problem is your product trying to solve?
    
-   Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
    
-   What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
    

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

The first iteration of the debt portal had separate pages for overpayment debt and copayment statements. Veterans needed to visit the Debt Portal to see any benefit debts they had while they had to go to the Medical Copay Tool (a different place) to see any medical copays that they had acquired as a result of health care visits.

In 2021, a dashboard-like experience where Veterans are now able to see all of their VA debts, debt letters and copayment statements in one place was created. The overarching goal was to allow Veterans to view *all their VA debts online and decrease the time it takes to resolve those debts while meeting congressional mandates.

This solution has been designed to empower the Veteran to see all their debt and copayment statements. We envision it will also grow to include future options that can help the Veteran to manage those debts such as requesting a waiver, submitting a dispute, offering a compromise, setting up a payment plan, and viewing payments made towards their debts. When Veterans make a submission, that information is routed to VBA and/or VHA.

Research was conducted on Debt Letters (overpayments) ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/debt-letters-mvp/research)) in 2020, Medical copays ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2021, Combined Debt Portal ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2022. We seek to perform additional foundational, exploratory research that can inform the long term vision of the debt portal and the roadmap. We will also share the debt portal summary page in the second part of the interviews in order to understand whether overpayments and copays should continue to have their own summary pages.

  

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

-   Decrease Veteran confusion and time it takes to review, manage or resolve their Meeting congressional mandates
    
-   Optimize Veteran experience and align to Veteran feedback
    
-   Allow DMC, VHA and others to promote a singular experience to Veterans to ease in communications and access to portal financial matters
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

**Goal 1, Exploratory and foundational:**

To understand the desirability of a holistic debt portal experience and what Veterans would like to see in one. We will present reaction/idea cards on slides with a word on them for Veterans to give feedback on.

Reaction card terms/ideas:

-   Financial hub
    
-   My VA benefits overview
    
-   Financial resources
    
-   Explain financial terms
    
-   Frequently asked questions
    
-   Personalization
    
-   One stop shop
    
-   Manage my VA debt benefits overpayments
    
-   Manage my copay bills
    
-   Benefits payment
    
-   Travel pay
    
-   Separation pay
    
-   Statement
    
-   Update dependents
    
-   Mobile app

**Goal 2, Conceptual and generative:**

To understand if the combined nature of the debt portal with copayment statements, overpayment debt, and the possibility of other types of debt in one place is desirable and easy to understand, versus separating these into their own pages. The information we learn from this part of the interviews will allow us to simplify the existing debt portal.

Original Concept for Debt Portal Copay + Debt Landing page:

-   This will allow Veterans to see an overview of all the money they owe VA 
in one place, which meets Congressional mandates + our users’ expectations
    
-   How the VHA copays and VBA debt data varies won’t be as evident if Veterans drill down into those separate debt types
    
-   Having an overview page instead of showing all detailed debt cards in one view
can reduce cognitive load. It could be overwhelming to see a long list of items, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as debts
