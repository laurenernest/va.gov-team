## Transcription 

### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > 

-  Have you use the appointments tool on via Gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before?
  > 

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > 

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > 

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > 

-  Ok, and you said that that has been happening since last year. Does that prevent you, then, from filing your claim?
  > 

- And just to make sure I'm understanding, have you had any claims at all that you haven't been able to file because of that? Or have they all eventually worked out so far?
  > 

- Do you create multiple claims for different appointments on the same day? If you ever have 2 appointments during one visit to a facility?
  > 

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > 


- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)

### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > 

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > 

- And can you tell me a little bit more about the numbers to the left of this information, how you perceive that those?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
  > 
  

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > That means I've filed the claim and it's waiting. Probably it would be like the first couple of days after you've filed the claim.
  > To me it's pretty important cause, if not, randomly like in my savings account, I'll get a travel reimbursement. I'm like, okay, which appointment was that for?
 
- Payment Canceled
  > To me it would be that they decided not to pay it. I would wonder why, you know, I kind of like a why after it.
  > Pretty important.
 
- Denied
  > That would mean they decided not to pay it. Again add the why after it. Even just a brief description of why it was denied.
  > Again, pretty important because I'd want to know if it's not gonna come in. I know some people, you know, depend on that to pay for their next appointment, you know, fuel for their next appointment. So to me, it would be pretty important to know it.

- Approved for Payment
  > Approved for payment means that they've okayed the mileage, and that at some point in time they'll send a check or direct deposit.
  > Again, very important.

- In Manual Review
  > I would have no clue other than my brain automatically goes to somebody pulled the file, and is like actually, manually looking at the report of my mileage. And you know, receipts or what not.
  > Pretty important cause it kinda tells you that it's gonna be a little bit longer before you get paid, or not paid.

- On Hold
  > Kind of to me means the same as in manual review, in the fact that somebody has pulled it and is looking it over for some reason or another, and I would put the "why" at the end of it.
  > Again, pretty important.

- Saved
  > That one means that I didn't have all my receipts and realized it. So I'm gonna go ahead and save it, so I don't have to put all the other information back in when I sign back in.
  > It's important but not drastically important.

- Claim Paid
  > That means they've sent a check or direct deposited the money for the mileage.
  > I guess pretty important, that way I knew the money was, you know. going to be in my count within couple days at least.

- Incomplete
  > Means kind of the same as far as the saved. It's just giving you a little bit more information that okay, you still have stuff to add to this claim. But again, there's the why? Because after it, if I saw that I would want to be able to have highlighted what was missing. So like if I forgot to put my phone number in, or the mileage in, or what not, having that description or the highlighted parts to tell me why it's incomplete.
  > Pretty important that way I knew I, you know, had something else to add to it, and I wasn't sitting there waiting for a claim that is incomplete to go through.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > No clue. I would Google it. I couldn't take any more steps. I'd have to go look it up.

- Claim Submitted
  > That means I had all my ducks in a row, and I hit the submit button, and it's telling me that I did. I did all the steps I could do.
  > Pretty important because then I can, you know, check it off my list of things to do for the day. I know that it's sent.

- Were there any other terms that you expected to be here that were not included?
  > No
