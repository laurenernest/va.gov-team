## Transcription 

### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > 

-  Have you use the appointments tool on via Gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before?
  > 

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > 

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > 

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > 

-  Ok, and you said that that has been happening since last year. Does that prevent you, then, from filing your claim?
  > 

- And just to make sure I'm understanding, have you had any claims at all that you haven't been able to file because of that? Or have they all eventually worked out so far?
  > 

- Do you create multiple claims for different appointments on the same day? If you ever have 2 appointments during one visit to a facility?
  > 

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > 


- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)

### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > 

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > 

- And can you tell me a little bit more about the numbers to the left of this information, how you perceive that those?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
  > 
  

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > Submitted for payment means it was approved but it's waiting for payment.
 
- Payment Canceled
  > I would guess payment canceled for some reason they found a reason not to pay you, you know, when it came time for the payment. 
 
- Denied
  > For whatever reason they denied it. Whoever approves it denied it.

- Approved for Payment
  > It got approved. No problem. So you'd be expecting a payment.

- In Manual Review
  > And manual review means it's just in probably one of the layers that it has to go through before it gets approved.

- On Hold
  > There must be a reason it's gonna be on hold. You gotta probably look into that.

- Saved
  > It's saved. I don't know why that would be here, I mean, save just means they're not doing anything with it. They just saved it.

- Claim Paid
  > I would think that would be the same as approved for payment, although it's already been paid. After that so approve for payment is approved but I haven't been paid, and then claim paid means it has been paid.

- Incomplete
  > Incomplete means they need more information.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is, for some reason they they don't wanna pay you, whether you make too much money, or we're ineligible or what, I would guess. That's kind of a tough one.

- Claim Submitted
  > It's been submitted but hasn't been paid.

> Some of them are kind of similar to each other though, I think. Submitted for payment and claim submitted, I would say one and 11 are similar to each other.

> I don't know exactly what saved would be. Just that's not telling you much information, so let's see... incomplete and manual.

> And like, I say, the tenth one is kind of a crazy one. I don't understand exactly what that would mean.

> (Reason denied) That would probably be a good thing to put in there. You wouldn't know. You'd have to go back and look and see where where would do it. But if it's gave you a reason there, maybe that would help you.

> The only thing that's happened is they've paid me just for I thought not as much as they paid me before, so I really didn't know why. But there was no way really to find that out. I was telling you about paying you one way or whatever, but so they would pay you, and it seemed partial to me, but then was no way to really figure it out. So it wasn't that big of a deal, but it'd be too hard to go figure out.
