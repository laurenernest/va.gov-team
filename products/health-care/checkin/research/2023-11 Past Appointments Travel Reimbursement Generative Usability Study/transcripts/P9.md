### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes, several times.

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > Yes, I did through the BTSSS.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > Right now it's my gamer laptop.

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > What it was is... I live in [city], which is a 170 miles one way nearly 400 miles round trip to [facility] where I had to go. So I when I went up there, and everything the lady said "Don't forget to do your travel claim. So this is my first time, so I went up the BTSSS and they already knew that I had a travel from [city]. They already knew that; it was already in it. So selected that and submitted my claim. So doing that was really really easy. The problem is, you know, it's been about 3 months now, maybe 4, and I've heard nothing, seen nothing. I mean, it's like it went into a black hole.

- Have you been able to check on that claim at all?
  > Yes I did and I don't see anything. Like I said it like went into a black hole.
  
  > That's one reason why I was glad to see this here and participate, because my first experience with it has not been good. I mean it. It seemed like everything was good. But then it just goes some black hole. There's no feedback from the system to me, whether it's been received, or what's happening. It's like nothing.

- Sounds like you'd done that once?
  > Yes, I could have done it for years, because I've been with the VA since 90. Never did it. I just did it now, because those trips get a little expensive.

- And did you have a multiple appointments during this trip, or just one appointment?
  > It was one appointment and what it was was to be able to procure a scooter, which I did. They were really good. The VA, I was totally shocked, within 2 weeks they got me the scooter plus the elevator to go on my truck. I was floored. I didn't expect that. I expected a year or more.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how youâ€™d want it, what would it be like? 
  > Customer feedback, for example, on a lot of different portions of the VA site and throughout the industry, so to say, you submit something and you automatically get some kind of of confirmation through email or text of the action being completed. Like I said, the biggest problem now,  the only way I was looking to see is, maybe if I had a small little deposit in my checking account. You know I haven't seen any of that. So that's the big thing. If I had a magic wand, there needs to be programmed in there some customer service, you know: Confirmation feedback, or like a status, you know, Hey is it still there or did it just magically disappear? That's the big thing I see.

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > Well, that's a hard question to ask, since they have never done one to completion for me. If it was done to completion, then it would be good, because that would help me be able to have gas and stuff to meet my appointments. On the surface that's awesome thing, but in reality I haven't seen anything to completion yet - just promises. 


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**

  > Okay, I can see that it already knows that I got appointment and where it's at. Now, here's the thing that have, and this is where it gets confusing sometimes, especially with the VA site. You say "sign in to va.gov to start start your claim," but then you have to hunt and peck and spend a lot of time trying to find the BTSSS. So, since this is for a travel claim, shouldn't the link be straight to the BTSSS

- Is that where you would expect it to go?
  > Well, yeah, because that's the thing I want to get to. Because if you go to va.gov, you go and look on there and nowhere, absolutely nowhere, does it say BTSSS anywhere. What you got to do is you gotta search and search and search until you finally find it.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
  > No, just that. I mean, I look down at the bottom and it does have a link to the BTSSS, but I would think I would want that up further up in the email so that I could go straight there. Besides that it's good, straightforward. 

- Okay, well, go ahead and select that first link that you said you would want to know where that's going (BTSSS).
  > What the va.gov or the BTSSS?

- Which link would you select in this case?
  > I would select the BTSSS, since that is the actual content of business for this email.

- For today, we'll go with the top one, the sign in to va.gov and see where that goes. Go ahead and click on that.

  > Another alternative is to note that they need to put this on the front page, you know, like they got, they got the claims and all that. If they just would add the link to the BTSSS.
  > I always use Id.Me becuase DS Logon is horrible. Most of the time it doesn't work. Now, the new login.gov I have not tried yet, so I always use Id.me.

**Appointment list**

  > Okay, this is what I expect to see when I do log into the VA. But, now see here. This is good if I click on the VA and it takes me straight to the travel reimbursement like it shows here, that's awesome. That is awesome. (referring to task card) My experience, unless they changed it lately, it didn't do that. You did not see that.

- So you said you were expecting to see this sort of page. But you weren't expecting to see something about travel is that, did I get that right?
  > Well, what it is is I would go up to mine and I would see any claims or appointments or anything, but it didn't have this travel reimbursement information. I would have to hunt BTSSS and login to there to see anything. But if y'all are doing it this way, this is the awesome way to do it.

- Is there anything confusing about the page?
  > No, actually it's pretty awesome because there I wouldn't know my appointments and I would know which ones that I can do a travel voucher with. Because, let me tell you why that's important. Because of I see the VA clinic in [city 1] and then they refer me to [city 2], whenever they they can't handle it or whatever. So [city 1] is basically an 80 mile round trip for me, a lot less mileage. So far I have not seen any of those qualified for travel reimbursement.
  > So my question is this: Does it show all? Are these all upcoming appointments, or only appointments that would involve travel reimbursement?

- What does it seem like they are? To understand your thoughts on this.
  > I mean, that would make it very easy. That way I'd know exactly one which ones I can determine whether qualify for the BTSSS reimbursement or not. I forget, I know there's a mileage criteria you have to make, and I can't remember what that is. Me, as a user, I'm looking at this "file travel claim reimbursement" and then I see these appointments and stuff. To me looking at it, it's saying all these here will qualify for travel reimbursement. Now, if that's true I don't know, but it appears so.

- Okay, that's good for us to know. So these are your upcoming appointments, so they wouldn't qualify yet, but let's take a look at the past appointment section.
  > Okay, now, these are appointments that have already been completed. Is that correct?
- Correct.
  > Ok, so it looks like, I can't tell from here, because one I would have to know where I'm at. It says Cheyenne VA medical center, but where am I at? Am I more than that mileage threshold? You see what I'm saying? Now, of course, maybe, and if it was me I would already know that, but looking at your thing here I don't know. I can only assume that it meets the mileage criteria, and that's why I see that little red button next to it, "one task to complete." So that kind of tells me that it's checking the appointment to see if it qualifies. Is that correct?

- So, the one task to complete. How are you interpreting that? Or what does that mean to you?
  > Well, since this is a travel reimbursement, it tells me that this is a travel reimbursement. If I click on it, will it tell me what that task is?

- Go ahead and click on it


**Details page**

  > Oh, well, see, it's tell me it's filed for travel reimbursement. So that's good. That's good. If I was to look at this directly then you've already prescreened my qualifications. At least, that's my assumption. My assumption, since you say there, I mean, cause it says right there, let me see, let me go back here.
  > (returns to past appointments) My assumption is, I see, one test to complete, and I click that. (selects appointments and returns to details page) And it said, basically file for travel reimbursement. That tells me that y'all have already prescreened my appointments to see if I even qualify for travel reimbursement.

- Ok go ahead and do that and go ahead and file and see where that goes. (list to details page and then selects action link)

  
**Intro page**

  > Ok, and this is very familiar. Pretty easy to do, going down through all that. That's that was very easy to do under the BTSSS. What I would ask on this is and this is where I was really upset, not upset with btsss, disappointed, is it did not send me any kind of customer service notifications once I put in the claim. Like, hey, it's been accepted, it's in the queue, or you know, all that kind of stuff or any updates. the question I have going back to this, will it generates an email to me for every request for filing a reimbursement? For example, I just got through having my appointment right? And since it knows already that this appointment qualifies for travel reimbursement, will it generate an email to me? So I can see sent to my email on record. 

- Is that what you would expect to happen?
  > That's what I would expect to happen, yes, because else how would I know unless I go in there? And, as you can see. there's a time limit, you know, 30 days. So the thing is, unless that was something like that, generally speaking, people would not be able to do it.

- Iterpretation of the page and the information included here? 
  > Well, I mean, it's straightforward. Like number one check eligibility. It seems like you're planning on building that function already. So whenever I get this, it already has determined whether I'm eligible or not.
  
  > Next thing is filing the claim. Yes, I mean with the link there, mileage-only travel claim, that's probably a lot what it would be. Some would be a little different, because they might have to have state overnight in a hotel room or something like that. So I like that because it differentiates 2 different things. So that's really good.

   > Now, number 3 is the problem I have. I don't see any statuses. It says yes, but I have failed, for me I have failed to see any.

- So can I ask you about step number 2? Have we done that step already?
  > Yes, I have done step number 2, file a mileage-only travel claim.

- Go ahead and select that then.

**Travel page**

> That's straightforward.

(Sped through questions)

**Review page**

  > Ok, let's see. So everything there is just confirming that...

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

  > Okay. Now that's good, because it check to see which 2 exact appointments. And there's a claim number. I did not see that when I did mine I did not see a claim number. I was looking for something like that.
  > Let's see, review the clean.

(clicks on reivew your claim link)
  > Okay, now, this here is a problem. I mean, it's got a lot of stuff on here, but what I was looking for said "Review your claim."  I was expecting to see a review of the claim I just submitted. And as you can see, it's nothing, it does not do that. It just gives me a bunch of information. So it's not doing anything that I asked or expected.
  
  > See? I don't know if I can, how I can go back on this. Let's see.
(goes back in browser to success page) 
  
  > See where it says review your claim? So I click that I should see you know particulars like my name, what I'm claiming, a claim number, everything that would be with that claim. See? And I click it again and it's not given me anything like that. All it's giving me is a bunch of information. Is it information that's related? Yes. But that's not what I want to see. I'm wanting to look at the claim that I just submitted.

- Ok, if that link took you here, what would you do at this point?
  > At this point I would have to go and search the BTSSS again, try to log in, and see if I could find any information. And that's exactly what I did, and it's like it didn't have anything there.

   > But this here's a big problem, this right here. Because if you want to confuse a lot of people, this will do it, because they're looking for that review and not for a bunch of questions and links.
