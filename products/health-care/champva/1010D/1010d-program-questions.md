|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking Testing?|Blocking for Production|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1||General|Which addresses (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants addresses) are required for fulfilling benefits?|No|Yes||
|2||General|Which phone numbers (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants phone numbers ) are required for fulfilling benefits?|No|Yes|||
|3|Yes|General|Should we rearrange the content to clarify the instance of a spouse, child or caretaker applying that is also a Veteran. The Sponsor/ Veteran language may need to be retooled. How common is this situation?|No|No|This is answered we are adding the VA Claim number and calling the Veteran Sponsor (Sponsor and using a sponsor and the applicant's names in the questions|
|4||General|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|No|No|The form owner at [OIRA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/) would make these changes (can remind stakeholders about it).| 
|5|New|General|When VA receives supplemental docs in the mail separate from an application, how do they link that doc with the correct application (i.e. is there a cover page or something?)|No|Yes||
|6||Sponsor|Is the VBA rating decision and the  DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) required?  If an applicant does not submit these docs, does this significantly increase the processing time or can the applicant skip these 2 doc uploads without little impact/ delay?|No|Yes||
|7|Yes|Sponsor|If a non-Veteran applicant doesn’t know where to find the VBA rating for their sponsor, how do they find a copy of it?|No|Yes|Based [the only info I could find](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/shshr4/who_can_look_up_my_va_disability_information/), the only ways someone who isn't a Veteran can get the information are if they are given power of attorney by the Veteran or if the Veteran has already sent a letter releasing that information to the person. With this is mind, I don't think there is really anything we can do here.|
|8||Sponsor|There is a question about how the Veteran (Sponsor) died? Does this affect anything in terms of benefits or what documents they need to upload (ie. a death certificate with the reason of death)?|No|Yes||
|9||Sponsor|What is the purpose of the sponsor’s address and phone number information (so we can explain to users)?|No|No|Check the 1010EZ, if it's on it, copy it. If not leave it off. We can also put recommendation to add content|
|10||Applicants|Can we confirm if caretakers are still eligible? There seems to be conflicting messages among the supporting informational materials for this program where caretakers are not listed as an eligible applicant.|No|Yes||
|11||Applicants|Are there any supporting docs needed for caretakers to upload for CHAMPVA enrollment?|No|Yes||
|12|yes|Applicants|Is there or should we put a limit on how many applicants can be added to the digital form. Syd and I asked the VFF team but it seems like this is unique to the services we are using on the 1010d. (Central Mail vs Box)|No|Yes|we can limit it to 12 for looking into the techincal limitations |
|13||Applicants|The requirements for the School Certs are very strict based on the current state of the form. It states that a letter or a form must be submitted and sent by the school to VA. This of course will blow up the file upload experience. Are the stakeholders willing to update this process to allow for the applicant to submit it. What types of documents will they take or not?|No, we will need to address the file upload this with stakeholders but this is deemed neccessary for the digital form. We need to know what types of documents they will accept as well for production |Yes||
|14|Yes|Applicants|Is the school certification only required for children of the sponsor?|No|No|It's only for dependents|
|15||Applicants|If the applicant was married to the sponsor, but the sponsor died, and they have not remarried, do they need to upload the sponsor’s death certificate?|No|Yes||
|16|New|Applicants|Would civil union documents be accepted as proof of marriage supporting document?|No|Yes||
|16|New|Third-party Signer|Do users need to submit third party signer/power of attorney supporting documents with their 1010D form? Since those documents aren't mentioned on the PDF version of the form or any of the CHAMPVA page content, we just want to be sure the 1010D  requires those forms as part of the submission process. And if so, do they allow submission of any of these third-party forms -- like the alternate signer form,  VA form 2122 or VA Form 2122a.|No|Yes||
|17||Third-party Signer|Is the phone number and address absolutely required?|No|Yes|Yes, but still want to ask stakeholders to confirm|
|18||Third-party Signer|Is the phone number and address absolutely required?|No|Yes|Yes, but still want to ask stakeholders to confirm|
|19||Confirmation Page|Would we be able to create a button for an applicant to email a copy of the confirmation page to themselves. We understand that some applicants may want to still mail the documents and we will provide the instructions to do so on the confirmation page.|No|No|This is more of a recommendation/backlog|
|20||Confirmation Page|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|No|No|(duplicate of 4)|
|21||Certification|There may be use case where the signer is a Veteran and does not provide an address/phone number. We want to accommodate folks experiencing homelessness, but also the signer is required to provide an address. as it currently stands. Is the signer having an address a requirement? If it is, how can we work around this for folks experiencing homelessness?|No|No|Continue with established pattern (with the thought that this is something to explore in the future)|
|21||Certification|We accommodate potential houselessness for the Veteran/Sponsor, but not for applicants or a third party signer (e.g, a VSO). Can we shift to accommodate that on our form, as well?|No|No|(same as above)|
