# Dec 1, 2023 | Jeremiah (IVC Manager) Interview for CHAMPVA form
Attendees from IVC: Kristen, Katrina, Luke, Jeremiah

## Direction questions for the IVC team.
### Who fills out this form? Do you have a rough statistical breakdown of respondents?
Answer (Luke/Kristen): 

Can be submitted by beneficiary, Veteran or Veteran security officer, or someone working on behalf of the veteran 

No hard statistical breakdown (not something officially tracked). 

Generally usually from the family (family submitting packet - for all veterans but have a wife, kids, etc.). Imagine it’s something they fill out together. Much smaller % from VSO. Assume it’s a joint effort - have to have all the identifying info to submit. 

### Do you have a rough idea of the average processing time?
Answer (Luke): 

Receive form from fax or mail - no portal. 

Document control management team - behind on backlog. About 30 days from when we receive it and when it’s scanned into the system. Once it’s received, eligibility team can work - takes 30+ days also (they’re helping DCM team work through backlog).

Submission from beneficiary to issuing card —> 6-8 wks 
(If there’s no backlog - have gotten it out in 10 days)

###  What systems does this information get entered into?
Claims payment and eligibility system (CP and E)

Images of the forms/forms themselves are entered into DAPER and trying to go to PEGA


DAPER = document repository and management system. CP&E = eligibility system where records are stored and decisions are made

### Could you provide us with a high-level overview of the form’s processing, from IVC’s first touchpoint to the last? A few words to describe each step would be sufficient; we don’t want to go into too much detail at this point.

Forms processing steps (Luke): 

Received in mail room (from post office) or as fax in work area

Documents go into document control data management dept - prescreen them (separate by veteran and beneficiary - put separators in them to have identifiers for each family member). Done on bubble sheets. 

Gets scanned into — Teleform then moves to DAPER

From DAPER - workflow into eligibility (first in, first out) and give to contact reps in eligibility that work through paper packet and make determination if they’re eligible or not. (Other part goes to review team - enters OHI [Other Health Insurance]. They’re made eligible from that). 

Cards go out - printed in batch in mailroom and goes to beneficiary. 

(Kristen) - Vista - CPE  (vista instance) - claims payment and eligibility system. Data entered into CPE. Images entered into DAPER. Working on another system - PEGA (trying to get that into). 

DAPER = document repository and management system

CP&E = eligibility system where records are stored and decisions are made

OHI form - they don’t deal with - they just send it to a different team

### Who is responsible for different touchpoints in the form’s processing, and can we schedule time with them?

Mailroom, document control, all falls under Luke Davis

DCDM - Rogelio Cortez

Erick Maes (Mays?) - resolution team

Owusuyeboah, Eric (HAC) - EEV

### What is the volume?


1750-2500 faxes a day

Also 300-500 pieces of mail (also miscellaneous documents - divorce, marriage certs, adoption paperwork, etc). (Katrina estimate: ~1 out of every 5 is an application (they usually come in with a lot of attachments)

OHI Cert 

School Cert

Medicare Card

10-7959c (OHI form)

Some are not forms - medicare card for example (over 65)

Can find information in the Veterans Benefits System (VBMS) - can find a lot of info they need and use as the responsible source to make determination with. But sometimes with an adopted child or 2nd/3rd/4th spouse, it may not be there yet. A lot of times they get married and send in the application the next day but the info isn’t in the system yet (VBMS).
