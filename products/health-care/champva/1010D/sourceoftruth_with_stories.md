# CHAMPVA Benefits Enrollment Form (VA Form 10-10d)
[Current PDF Form](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/VA_Form_10-10d.pdf)

## Introduction page

## [H1] CHAMPVA benefits

Are you the spouse, surviving spouse, child or caretaker of a Veteran who is permanently and totally disabled or a Veteran who has died? If you don’t qualify for TRICARE (the Department of Defense’s health care program for active-duty and retired service members and their families), you may be able to get health benefits through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). Through this program, we cover the cost of some of your health care services and supplies. This is called cost sharing.
<br/>
###  [H2] What benefits do I get with CHAMPVA?
You may use CHAMPVA as a standalone service or as an additional health benefit to your other health insurance or Medicare.


With CHAMPVA, you’ll be covered for services and supplies when we determine they are medically necessary and were received from an authorized provider. When providers are performing services within the scope of their license or certification, we consider them to be authorized.

#### [H3] Covered services include:
- Ambulance service
- Ambulatory surgery
- Durable medical equipment (DME)
- Family planning and maternity
- Hospice
- Inpatient services
- Mental health services
- Outpatient services
- Pharmacy (prescription medicines)
- Skilled nursing care
- Transplants<br/>


When you’re signed up for CHAMPVA, you’ll get a copy of the CHAMPVA Program Guide. This guide will tell you more about covered and non-covered services and supplies.

###  [H2] How is CHAMPVA different from other health Insurance?
 <! --- need to add some content here if this section has more evidence that it would be valuable to the applicants --->


###  [H2] Am I eligible for health benefits through CHAMPVA?

You may be eligible for CHAMPVA health benefits if don't qualify for TRICARE and the Veteran you're connected to can be described as one of the following,


- Has been rated permanently and totally disabled for a service-connected disability by a VA regional office
- Has died from a VA-rated service-connected disability
- Was at the time of death rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability

####  [H3] What is a service-connected disability? 
<! --- I added this based on some of the feedback from the stakeholder interviews. If we don't have enough evidence that this will be helpful to our user I can remove it to save the real estate --- >
A service-connected disability is a disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by the Veteran’s active-duty service. A permanent disability is one that’s not expected to improve.

If the Veteran you're connected to fits that description and your status and relationship match the following the factors below you may be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits.
