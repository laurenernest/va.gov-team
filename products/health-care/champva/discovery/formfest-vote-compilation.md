## Takeaways
- Acknowledge and practice fundamental Form design principles.
- Usability testing early and often (this is just good UX, but it’s nice to see it’s acknowledged in the space and to be reminded).
- Prepare people to complete the form by telling them what to expect and what additional information/documents might be needed.
  - Make sure that all of the information being collected on the forms is needed.
  - Sometimes, the owner doesn’t even need everything that is being collected, and you can reduce the burden just by asking questions and cutting the fat.
  - If you don’t need to know, don’t ask!
  - Ask yourself: “I need to ask for ______ so I can ______.” If the answer isn’t obvious, seriously consider removing the question.
- Reduce burden on the user. 
  - Can information be prefilled if they’re logged in or if they’ve filled it out elsewhere on the form?
  - Forms should be dynamic so that users only see questions that are relevant to them.
  - Present the form and process in a way that centers how the user thinks about it, rather than how your organization thinks about the information (again, just good UX, but nice to be reminded).
  - If we have additional burden, it’s better to place it on data entry and analysis than on the people we’re trying to serve.
- Don’t forget to step back and take a look at things from a service design perspective occasionally, and look for opportunities to improve the whole process for owners and participants.
- Forms as a conversation - Policy as code.
  - This is a short adage to remind us how we should be working with forms and the policies behind them.
- Remember that a well-done form can create trust, and a poorly-done form can break it.
- Tell users why you’re asking for specific information and how that information will be used, especially if it’s not immediately obvious and could be sensitive (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, pronouns). 
  - Providing context and explanations to users is important.
  - Let people self-identify wherever you can, and always provide a “prefer not to respond” option.
    - Provide long text fields with helper text.
  - Don’t force people to choose just one option for identity-based questions.
- Define terms such as sex and gender. Don’t assume people know how the government defines them.
- Don’t put unnecessary restrictions on what users can enter for their names - no character limits or restrictions. Some names are very short, some are very long, and some contain “special” characters. All of that’s legitimate, and it causes frustration for users when they can’t enter their actual name.
- Use plain language whenever possible. If legalese is needed, work with legal and show user testing data to demonstrate the benefit of plain language. 
    - If you can’t remove the legalese entirely, consider glossaries or tools like “What does this mean?” to include both.
