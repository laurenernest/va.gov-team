[2023-04 Enhanced Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655, FSR) Usability Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/269)


	This was forms research, applicable to what we are doing.


[2023-05 AVS MVP on VA.gov Prototype Usability Test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/320)


	There are some relevant general findings here, and they used Figma! It would be nice to know more about how they made that happen.


[2022-05 Forms Library Review Page Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/110)


	These are a lot of the assets we will be using to create the prototypes for our forms, very relevant stuff.


[2022-06 Forms Library Review Page Round 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/143)


	This continues the research on the components included in the Forms Library. Most of this will already be updated for us, most likely, but knowing the history will help us.


[2022-06 10-10EZ Short Form Usability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/154)


	Another form ran through a usability test; the sample wasnâ€™t ideal, but this is likely realistic for the kind of sample we can expect. The feedback from the findings will very likely be relevant to our work moving forward.


[2022-02 1095-B Tax Form Interview & Usability Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/84)


	This is representative of some of the pushback we will almost inevitably encounter with older individuals when digitizing anything. It is good to be aware of this so that we can help work toward ways to inspire confidence in this demographic.


[2021-11 Caregiver, Content-specific comprehension study for the 10-10CG document upload](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/34)


	This good study on content will help us understand how many veterans might react to different phrasing and delivery. Useful for content design and delivery to create the correct impression with the veteran, thereby leading to a better experience.
