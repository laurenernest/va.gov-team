## Research Goals
Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

This test helped us acheive two goals:

**UAT:** Verify via UAT that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features and data is populating as expected.

**Mental Model Study:** Understand Veteran's mental models as they choose a facility or provider when scheduling an appointment. 


## Research Questions

**UAT:**
1. Are participants able to navigate between to the appointments feature from My VA and MHV on VA.gov?
1. Are participants able to navigate their appointments lists?
1. Can participants easily print their appointments lists?
1. Are users at Cerner facilities able to navigate to My VA Health?

**Mental Model Study**
1. Does the process of selecting a clinic (VistA) or provider (community care) meet participant expectations?
1. What other information would be helpful when scheduling with a provider or clinic?

## Methodology 

We ran a virtual moderated test in two parts: an evaluative UAT study and a generative mental model study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

1. Participants will be able to easily navigate to the appointments tool from all entry points.

_Definitely False_

We didn't test all entry points with all participants. Results below indicate the number of participants who passed through the point listed:




2. Participants will be able to easily print a list of their appointments.

_Definitely True_

3. Participants at Cerner facilities will be able to easily navigate to My VA Health.

_Not enough information_

Two participants were at Cerner facilities, so we don't have enough information to draw a conclusion.

4. The process of selecting a facility, clinic, or provider during scheduling will meet participant expectations.




## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. Logging in was the biggest challenge to accessing the appointments tool.

Half of participants ran into trouble while logging in, and all commplained that the process of logging in can be frustrating.

Once they logged in, X participants easily navigated to the appointments list

**Login (all)**
<abbr title="">About half</abbr> of our participants had trouble during the login process, and <abbr title="8 out of 12">most</abbr> reported that they generally find login to be frustrating.

**My VA (11)**
All but one participant was able to navigate easily from My VA to Appointments (one used other entry points.) The one who struggled was a Cerner user, so they didn't have a direct path to the appointments tool from My VA.

**Static landing page (all)** 
<abbr title="9 out of 12">Most participants</abbr> were able to navigate to the Appointments tool through the static landing page. 5 complained about information overload on this page, or that it was frustrating to land on it after logging in. One would have abandoned the process at this page if they had to deal with it outside of the test.

**My HealtheVet**
We started most participants on VA.gov, so they usually encountered the My HealtheVet National Portal after they had seen the appointments tool and the MHV on VA.gov home page. This was the most challenging path to appointments, and we'll cover it in the finding [TBD]

1. Participants easily navigated the appointments list.

X participants had no trouble opening a details page and exploring their appointments.

X participants struggled with the Pending option.

X participants couldn't find their past appointments without help.

2. Participants easily navigated to the MHV on VA.gov home page.

Only one participant was unable to navigate to the MHV on VA.gov home page. All others were able to use at least one method:
- X used the breadcrumb
- X used the My HealtheVet button on the navbar
- X used the dropdown in the Profile menu

3. All participants were able to easily find and use the print button.

4. Navigating multiple portals was a barrier to finding appointment information.

We asked participants to explore My HealtheVet fro the MHV on VA.gov home page. Most went to Secure Messaging, some to medical history. Afterwards, we asked them if they could find a way to schedule an appointment.



5. Finding five

6. Finding six

7. Finding seven
