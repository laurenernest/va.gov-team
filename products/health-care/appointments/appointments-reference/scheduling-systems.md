# VA Appointment Management Tools and Systems [WIP]
Systems used by VA to manage Veteran appointments.



## ADR - Administrative Data Repository
The Administrative Data Repository (ADR) was established to provide support for the administrative data elements relative to multiple categories of a person entity such as demographic and eligibility information. Although initially focused on the computing needs of the Veterans Health Administration, the ADR is positioned to provide identity management and demographics support for all IT systems within the Department of Veterans Affairs. (1)

### AudioCARE
AudioCARE automatically handles both inbound and outbound communications between a healthcare provider organization and its patients. This product can send patients reminders, updates, notifications, and emergency communications through telephone, web services, and Short Message Service (SMS) text messages.

All Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) used during the calling process is retrieved from VistA and stored in a temporary file within the AudioCARE platform.

Cerner
AKA Cerner Millennium

VA is transitioning to a new electronic health record (EHR) system — the software that stores health information and tracks all aspects of patient care — over a 10-year period scheduled to end in 2028. The new system connects VA medical facilities with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard and participating community care providers, allowing clinicians to easily access a Veteran’s full medical history in one location. VA’s Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization (OEHRM) manages deployment of the new system. (1)

Virtual Care Manager (VCM)
Virtual Care Manager enables clinicians to create*, view, and join video visits and create group visits. With Virtual Care Manager, it is easy to invite Veterans' family or caregivers, as well as additional VA staff, to video visits.(1)

VistA
AKA “Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture”
A health information system deployed across all veteran care sites in the United States. VISTA provides clinical, administrative, and financial functions for all of the 1700+ hospitals and clinics of the Veterans Health Administration[1] VISTA consists of 180 clinical, financial, and administrative applications integrated within a single transactional database [1].

In May, 2018, the VA awarded a contract to Cerner Corp to replace VistA with the commercial off-the-shelf EHR, Cerner Millenium. Pilot implementations took place in the fall of 2020, and by November, 24 million veteran health records had been migrated to the new platform. The projected completion for migration of all VA sites is 2028. [2]

CPRS - Computerized Patient Record System
The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is a VistA application that
enables users to enter, review, and continuously update all the information
connected with any patient. In addition, CPRS supports clinical decision making, with order-checking, alerts, clinical reminders, and patient record
flags.



VistA Scheduling Enhancements GUI (VSEGUI)

VS GUI is a software module that allows schedulers to make appointments quickly by
viewing multiple appointment request types and multiple clinics in one screen. A scheduler
can easily view patient requests for service, find the next available open appointment, view
the provider’s availability in multiple clinics, and track a patient’s appointment process.
