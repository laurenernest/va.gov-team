# Product Outline: 10-7959f-1 Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Registration

---

## Overview
Under the IDEA Act, all user facing forms need to be digitized. For Veterans who are outside the US and are eligible for health coverage for a service-related condition, providing the Foreign Medical Program registration form online would allow them to more easily and quickly apply rather than go through the current paper process.

## Problem Statement
How might we improve the experience of Veterans living overseas who are applying for VA health care services? Veterans who are living or traveling outside the U.S. with a service connected disability are only able to apply for health care benefits through mail or fax. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans are able to fill out the registration form online on VA.gov
- Veterans reduce the time, effort and costs spent filling out and mailing paperwork
- The time spent waiting to hear back on application status is reduced for the Veteran

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans are confused or uncertain around the steps in the process or how to apply online
- Veterans encounter errors during the online application process or the application does not submit
- Veterans have low confidence in the online process or have concerns around online security

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduce the volume of paperwork being processed that comes in through mail and fax
- Reduce the time and effort spent processing paper forms
- Reduce the amount of resubmissions due to missing information or documents

## Undesired Business Outcomes
