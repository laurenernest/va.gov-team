## Interview Script

### Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is _____ and _____ is taking notes.

We've invited you here today to help us improve a website for Veterans. We'll use our time today to explore two different ideas for the site together.  Before we jump in with prompts and questions, I first have some information to confirm with you:

#### For screenreader or mobile sessions
- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Are you able to use that during our session today?
- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you primarily use your phone to access the internet. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you before we get started:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- Any questions I can answer at this point?

- Okay, I have a few colleagues waiting to join our call who would like to sit in and listen to our conversation. **Do you feel comfortable with a few more people joining us?** _If yes, admit those in the waiting room. Ask them to introduce themselves.__
- We're almost ready to get started, I just need to ask your permission to do two more things. First, **are you okay with me recording our conversation** so I can listen to it later if I forget something? _Once you hit record, ask again._
- And lastly, I'd also like to ask your **permission to share small clips from the recording** with other individuals who work on the website. These clips would only be shared internally and we would remove identifying information to protect your anonymity. Would this be okay with you?

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few questions... 

1. What types of VA benefits if any do you currently receive?
      a. Have you received other benefits in the past?
      b. If yes, which?
   
2. What experience do you have with VA.gov (or the VA mobile app)?
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose?
   
3. _If receive VA health care_: Do you have experience with My HealtheVet? _If participant isn't familiar, don't help them remember, just move on_
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose? 
   
### Screen sharing instructions - 5-10 minutes**

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the different sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

#### Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

#### Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

#### Open prototype
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

  - Design A: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/dec27c9852d5bc105e841a3d0bc989ff
  - Design B: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/63418c9f42aaf22d4c8198d968ce91cf

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text.

_Once the participant is done reading_: What would you do next? Go ahead and do that.

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_

-  Before you click on anything, how would you explain this site you landed on.
   - How do you know? 
-  What if anything is surprising about landing here on this page?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Where does participant think they landed?
- What are sign posts the participant points to?

### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

- Let's move slowly on this next task; the next thing I'm going to ask you to do is imagine that you want to look at the images and read the report from your x-rays.
- Before you click anything, I want to hear where you might naturally start looking first? 
- And what are you looking for?
- Why focus on this ________ (secondary or primary nav) and not the other?
- Let's talk more in detail about this area (the secondary nav):
   - Could you walk me through each of the links laid out here?
   - Where would you expect to be taken if you clicked that link?
   - What if anything about finding your way around here seems confusing?
- Okay, now go ahead and click around as needed to complete the task of viewing your x-ray images and report. _Guide as needed._
- _Once participant arrives_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding your x-ray results?
   - Why do you give that rating?
- Now that you see where to find your x-rays on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would you put it?
- I'm going to again ask you a question I posed earlier: If you were on the phone with a friend who is also a Veteran and is looking for this site, how would you explain how to get to this site?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Which nav does the participant gravitate towards first?
- What meaning / signficance do they give the different nav options?
- Which links are they wrong about? Which are confusing?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Does the label for "medical records" seem to fit the task for the participant?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?

#### Things to note (mobile)
- Does participant notice dropdown nav?
- Does participant understand abbreviations?

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

- For the next task, imagine that you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Where would you go to do that?
- I'm seeing you gravitate towards ______. Why are you going there first?
- What are you looking for?
- _Once participant arrives on Appointments_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where you might schedule an appointment?
   - Why do you give that rating?
- Now that you see where to schedule an appointment on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Desktop: Do they see the Appointments link right away? Or does it take time? / Mobile: Do they go right to the dropdown nav this time?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

- The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies? 
_Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_
   - _If participant clicked link to get "home": _What did you expect to see when you clicked "My HealtheVet" or "home"?
   - On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where to order medical supplies?
   - Why do you give that rating?
- Now that you see where to order supplies on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?

## Tasks for Prototype 2 

Okay, I'm getting ready to share the second link with you within the Zoom chat, just like last time. And again, just like last time, when you open the link it'll look like a website but it's just a prototype so you won't see your real information on the screens. I'm sending you the link now:

## Interview closing questions - 5 minutes

Thank you for your patience and for going through those tasks again using this second version of the site. You can close out the web browser and stop sharing your screen. I just have a few final questions to ask you:

- What role if any do you think icons played in your ability to navigate the site?
- Mobile: What role if any do you think the dropdown played in your ability to navigate the site? 
- Desktop: How about the "home" button?

- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran who wanted to use these tools, how would you explain the relationship between this site and the VA?
- Anything I didn't ask you about that you want to share about your experience? 

Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts today.
