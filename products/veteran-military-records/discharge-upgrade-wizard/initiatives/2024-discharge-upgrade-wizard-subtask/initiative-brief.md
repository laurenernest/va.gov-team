# Discharge Upgrade Wizard: Update to subtask pattern

This initiative will update the build of the Discharge Upgrade Wizard (DUW) to use the Design System subtask pattern, as well as modernize the content.

## Top-line Description / Goal(s)
The existing discharge upgrade wizard was built in Vets.gov days. It does not use current design or content patterns. It requires a lot of scrolling due to the legacy pattern. We are also unsure if the information within the wizard remains correct.

Based on learnings from the PACT Act wizard, this effort will improve the ability for Veterans to determine their eligibility for a discharge upgrade by re-modernizing the product to align with current VA.gov design and content standards, and convert to a subtask pattern.

## Background

The wizard pattern has been deprecated by DST in favor of the Subtask pattern. The Discharge Upgrade Wizard needs to be converted to a subtask pattern. Designs for this can be found in [this Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/s/20ea8818-8846-4f47-b341-7dc0ee6fc57e).
