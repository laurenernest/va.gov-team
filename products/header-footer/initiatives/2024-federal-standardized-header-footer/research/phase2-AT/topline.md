This topline summary is a preliminary summary of research findings observed in the research sessions. The purpose is to share what was learned in the sessions before the full research report is complete.

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer**, as well as Veteran sentiment on the new USA logo branding, **from Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier assistive technology**. 

## Participants
On January 29 - February 5, 2024, we talked over Zoom with **9 Veterans**--2 of which were also family members of Veterans. 
- One third (3 of 9) saw the **mobile** version of the prototype
- Two thirds (6 of 9) saw the **desktop** version of the prototype 


## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. The **page design was well received overall**. Participants  mentioned specifically the page layout, the links in the header and footer, the placement of the *Sign in* button in the top right, the simple font with good color contrast, the menus that start out collapsed, and the ample spacing between touchable links on mobile devices. 
1. **None of the 9 participants mentioned missing the "VA" logo**, so it seems fine to not have that on the page. Everyone noticed the VA seal and the text "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs", which was sufficient to recognize the site as pertaining to the VA.
1. **Successful wayfinding to tasks seemed *not* adversely affected by the new header and footer**. Each participant completed 5-7 wayfinding tasks. 3 of 9 participants completed all of their tasks without any help, while others were challenged by a few of them. Tasks that were most difficult were FOIA (for participants not looking in the federal footer area), and changing address (for participants who had trouble finding the Auth menu).

### Authentication issues
1. After signing in using the prototype, **one third of the participants (3 of 9, which was 2 on mobile and 1 on desktop) didn't recognize that they were actually signed in** because the user interface didn't change much. The subtle change of the "Sign in" button to "Sign out" (on mobile) or their first name (on desktop) wasn't enough for everyone to notice.
1. After signing in, ***ALL 3 of the mobile users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu**, which was located *under their name within the mobile header menu*. They didn't think to click on the *Menu* button because they were looking for their name or something like "My profile" at the top of the screen.
1. After signing in, ***2 of 6 desktop users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (by clicking on their name), while the other 4 found it easily. One participant's difficulty was because he didn't notice the triangle dropdown indicator to the right of his name (he was using a screen magnifier, and the shape was different from the carat symbol in the menu bar). The other participant's difficulty was due to confusion about what her screen reader said: "button menu", and she wondered whether it was a button or a menu.
1. After opening the Auth menu, **all participants recognized and clicked on *Profile***, which was the correct navigation path. 

### Footer issues
1. **4 participants (3 desktop, 1 mobile) misperceived the bottom of the page and didn't see any of the links in the black federal footer** until prompted by the moderator to scroll farther down. 3 of them stopped scrolling at the blue VA footer, and 1 stopped at the white USA logo. One person in phase 1 also stopped scrolling at the white USA logo, so that's a total of 2 participants from both phases of research.
1. **3 participants interpreted the footer as only the black federal part**, and then when they were looking for links that they thought would be in the footer *(Careers, Contact us)*, they **looked only there and not in the blue VA part** of the footer. They interpreted the blue VA part of the footer as part of the page content, not part of the footer where they should be looking.
1. **3 participants looked for *Find a VA Location* in the blue VA  footer**, which is not there in the prototype (but *is* there in Production). Two participants instead selected the *State Veterans Affairs Offices* link that enables you to pick a state and then go to that state's VA link (unmodernized page), which doesn't go to the Facility Locator. The third participant looked in 3 different columns of the blue footer before looking in the header instead. 
1. **2 participants said that the blue VA part is too large** and has too many links. One person in phase 1 said the same thing, so that's a total of **3 people from both phases of research.**

### Header issues
1. 

### Accessibility issues to investigate
1. p3 (desktop using MAGic 14 screen reader and magnifier) **didn't notice the 4th column of footer links** with his magnified screen. When we looked at it together later, he said that there's a larger gap after column 3 than there is between the other columns, so he assumed that there was nothing more to the right.
1. p10 (desktop using VoiceOver on an iPad) was **confused by navigation in the blue footer because he didn't perceive any columns but saw (with limited vision) the screen jump**, which happened every time he moved from the last link in one column to the first link in an adjacent column.
   > *"I'm down here at the lower part of screen. Now I'm back at the top of the screen, and...I think I did something wrong or something's going funky with the screen" (p10).*
1. p1 (desktop using JAWS) was confused about why the **screen reader said "button menu" for her name**. This was the button to open the Auth menu. 
1. p10 (desktop using VoiceOver on an iPad) tried to click on the *Contact Us* column header in the blue footer. They **couldn't tell that it wasn't interactive** from what the screen reader said. This same participant also thought that the *Get education benefits* header text on the *VA Benefits and Health Care > Education and training* page.
1. p11 (desktop with the font enlarged ~150%) said that they would **prefer a larger font**, which they suggested doing by having less white space on the left and right sides of the content. 

### Content feedback to consider

### How recognize as an official government website
12. Most (TBD of 9) participants said that they would **look at the URL to see if it's *.gov* or *VA.gov*** because the words and graphics could be spoofed. 
1. Participants also mentioned other features of the page:
     - **VA seal** (TBD)
     - "An official website of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the footer (TBD)
     - "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the header (TBD)
     - "USA Government" in header (TBD)
     - Logo, typeface, and accordions of other VA pages (TBD) 
     - "USA" logo in footer (TBD)
     - "Veterans Crisis Line" (TBD)

### Feedback on the USA Logos
14. **TBD of 10 participants thought the colored USA logo in the header was TBD** with varying degrees of sentiment: 
 


18. **TBD participants liked the black/white USA logo in the footer better than the colored one** in the header because it stands out, looks good, and seems more official.
