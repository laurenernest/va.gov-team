## Current design

We are adding a toxic exposure section to the 526 ez disability benefits claim form, allowing Veterans to specify some aspects of their service history that might qualify them for additional disability benefits related to toxic exposure. This brings the digital form into parity with the paper 526 ez form on these exposure questions. 

For our initial release, we will include this toxic exposure section only for new conditions (not already-rated conditions or claims for increase), as an MVP.

## Project background

[@evelynhilbrichdavis](https://github.com/evelynhilbrichdavis) led usability research in August 2023. See [research findings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VLqXexB72C_fPjUyw1MwL2Pjznvsg_q_UYbg16xk-iM/edit#).  

## Outstanding questions and next steps

1. Accessibility-focused usability testing
   We have introduced some new variations on form components that we have accessibility questions about. For example, we are including a "not sure" checkbox that sets other fields to null when checked. We want to ensure this interaction between fields is apparent, consistent with user expectations, and does not cause confusion, particularly to screen reader users.
2. Measure usage in production
   What might we learn from how people are using the form / where they are dropping off / error logs?
3. Seek feedback / user data from support teams
4. Seek feedback from VSRs on real-world usage
   How useful is the toxic exposure data received from the digital form? What might not be useful and could be worth eliminating or formatting differently?
5. Expand the toxic exposure section to other disability claims (extending beyond new conditions)

## Background on decisions

### Entry point to toxic exposure questions

#### Current approach 

The current approach is to keep the "How is your condition related to your service?" question unchanged.

Later, we ask if any conditions are related to toxic exposure and list all newly entered conditions in checkboxes. The Veteran can check which, if any, of these conditions are related to toxic exposure.

#### Other approaches considered

We considered adding a radio button indicating toxic exposure to the "How is your condition related to your service?" question.

<img width="316" alt="Screenshot of 'How is your condition related to your service?' question - a variation with an additional radio button of 'My condition was caused by toxic exposure during my military service' " src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/1a72c2b8-c7c9-4cde-b0a2-b813fd8f48d0">


#### Rationale

Keeping these two questions ("How is your condition related to your service?" and "Are any of your conditions related to toxic exposure during your military service?") separate will eventually (when we add the toxic exposure section for all types of disability claims) allow the Veteran to indicate toxic exposure along with any other existing answer for "How is your condition related to your service?". 

If we used the "other approach considered", we would make toxic exposure mutually exclusive of any of the other service connection options. This would not reflect reality for many cases and would mean that the Veteran would only be able to provide information on follow-up questions related to one of these radio button options.
