# Request & Support Process

## Overview: 

Top Goals:  One of our 2024 OKRs is develop a Request & Support process for va.gov, which will help us help other teams far more efficiently than currently.

* Create an intake process for feature requests, updates, bug fixes, data requests, etc.
* Allow folks to self-service (access pre-existing materials/answers/FAQ's as much as possible)
* ability or view all requests holistically

Create solutions to manage & fulfill requests from other va.gov Product Teams, possibly including:
* Intake form
* Summation of the work we need to do

Potential add-ons (but not primary goal)
* Estimate of the time it will take (post initial in-take)
* Prioritization of the request vs. other requests (should be out of scope, dependent of PRODUCT prioritization)

## Problem Statement: 
Currently, we have no clearcut and a disjointed/one-off process to field requests from other product teams.  In order to triage, manage and fulfill those requests, we need to clearly define a workflow/process in order to be able to track the overall workload created by those requests.

## Potential deliverables:
- research findings

## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on:
* Developing the processes as needed to support other teams' requests for feature requests, updates, bug fixes, data requests, etc.
* Sign-in-Service intake requests and routing to the appropriate persons on the Identity Core team for follow-up action
* Creating metrics

## Out of Scope: 
*  Sign-in-Service documentation updates
*  Sign-in-Service bug/feature resolution

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | How does this solution address the problem?  |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
|Other Team | How to explain what is needed  | Standardized intake form will allow proper explanation  |
|Our Team | What work are we doing?  | Summation of the work |
|Other Team | When will we be finished?  | Estimation of the the work |
|Our Team | Which request should focus on?  | Product prioritizations  |

| User          | Problem       | How does this solution address the problem?  |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| VA Dev Team | I have a problem with authenticating users to my application  | Standardized intake form will allow me to get information on how   |

## Assumptions:
* We leverage previous experience supporting other teams to create this process.
