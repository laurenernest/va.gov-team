## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Obtaining a representative can occur any time a Veteran needs support with benefits along their journey. Including, but not limited to; getting out, starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, or aging.


### Goals<a id="goals"></a>

- Understand Veterans' motivations for seeking representation, why they selected their representative, and what that experience has been like.

- Understand how users navigate to and use the Find a Representative tool on both desktop and mobile devices.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

- Information on Veterans’ motivations and behaviors surrounding representatives will inform the MVP and future experiences.

- User testing will inform navigation and usability of the Find a Representative tool.


## Research Questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What prompts Veterans to find representation?

2. What has the Veterans’ experience been with their representatives?

3. Where would they expect to find this experience on VA.gov?

4. Do Veterans’ understand the information shown? Is there any information missing?

5. What are Veterans’ expectations of the experience?

6. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

7. Are the next steps clear and actionable?


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

**Semi-structured interview** / The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions to learn about their representative selection process and engagement with their representative.

**Usability testing** / Veterans will be asked to engage with VA.gov and a prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.


## Key Findings<a id="key-findings"></a>

1. Veterans main goal for getting a representative is to aid in fast, comprehensive, successful filing of their claims. When that goal is not met, Veterans look for alternative support.

2. Representatives can make or break a Veterans claims experience causing Veterans to rely heavily on peer / family referrals, and online research, when selecting a representative.

3. During the application process, and first meeting, most Veterans preferred in-person support from a representative to build trust and comfort with the process.

4. Veterans continuously struggled with understanding representative terms and roles.

5. While most Veterans had never considered VA.gov to find a representative, after seeing the experience every Veteran wanted to use it immediately.


## Details of Findings<a id="details-of-findings"></a>

### Key Finding 1<a id="key-finding-1"></a>

**Veterans main goal for getting a representative is to aid in fast, comprehensive, successful filing of their claims. When that goal is not met, Veterans look for alternative support.**

- Most of the participants we spoke to were actively looking for, or recently found, a new representative due to lack of current representative support. For some, lack of support led to claim denial, lower than anticipated disability ratings, never getting benefits, or being taken advantage of by ‘claim sharks’.

- One participant reached out to a representative due to a change in medical conditions.

- _Quotes/ Lack of Representative Support_

> _“Us guys from Vietnam, we’re being overlooked. I understand with the PACT act we qualify with agent orange. That’s been hard to prove. It’s been frustrating. I go to the VA hospital. I have a lot of appointments because I have a lot of things going on in my life. I learned that here in the southern Arizona area is what they call a Vet Center. So on the way back, I live about 45 minutes from the VA hospital in Tucson, I swung by the Vet Center and never even knew it was there. The person they have there is not a VSO I think. That person is probably a liaison for the VA or something … I found out he’s scheduled out over a month. It’s a nice place to go sit and talk to other vets and have coffee, but nothing is getting done. I’m in my late 70s now, if I do get awarded, I got maybe 10 years left on my life. It’s really late that I can have some benefits.” - P1_

> _“I have a really hard time with VSOs, American Legion, VFW \[Veterans of Foreign Wars]. On LinkedIn they’re like “we’re here for you,” well you know what, come here, 500 miles in this direction. I don’t care if we’re a small number, don’t say you’re going to help and then don’t help. It took 4 years to be able to see this VSO who is the one to help us. It’s frustrating.” - P2_

> _“I hate that I have to pay out of pocket for benefits that are owed to me. I guess if I have to see any money that’s what I have to do. The DAV was not helpful, the Arizona VSOs were not helpful. Everyone that said they were here to help have not been able to help.” - P3_

> _“Says he helped me, but he really didn't. He was just a pain in the butt. I think there are multiple issues here with the ‘help’. ‘Help’ I use air quotes because my VSO says he helped me, and his help consisted of telling me to fill out forms and review my records and send them to him. Meantime, he also said to apply online, which I was doing. So I just followed the online thing, and it was done before he even did anything, so it was like a duplication. He didn't do anything I couldn't have done myself, and he was not helpful by reaching out. He wasn't proactive or anything. It was kind of my obligation to follow his instruction, which was, gather all this data, make copies of all these things, and send it to me, fill out these forms, go, get these interviews and send it to me, and then he would upload them, and as it turned out, he did that. And then he found somehow in some portal, he said, your portal has already been accessed and you've already uploaded the information that you gave me, so just let me know if you need my help. In my opinion he was just a waste of effort.” - P5_

 > _“The way it happened before when I went to the DAV in downtown Alexandria was the guy basically typed up as I was talking and sent that in. And so I was rejected for headaches when it was a stroke. Not a headache. So … you know she basically told me it was the wording, you have to use legal wording, that’s what they understand. I don’t know how correct that is or not but … well I wouldn’t mind doing it myself without a representative but I don’t know if that’d be rejected again? So I don’t know, I just fell into that category of let someone else do it that knows better than me.” - P7_

> _“Oh, I am definitely calling this woman. Just what I'm seeing here about what you know what a representative can help you file a claim. You know. Submit your appeal and and everything else. So it's you know. I'm sitting here looking at and going. You know what this woman has been going all over Cosmelo and Mexico, and you know Cayman Islands and everything on. I'm more than sure it's all on Veteran's dimes and she, you know she's constantly advertising that poem gettin’ a travel bug again. You know, and and I'm sittin here gettin nothing done. So I'm sure you can understand why, I'm frustrated with it. And I'm definitely calling her. And after I get this set up, yeah, she's toast.” - P7_


### Key Finding 2<a id="key-finding-2"></a>

**Representatives can make or break a Veterans claims experience causing Veterans to rely heavily on peer / family referrals, and online research, when selecting a representative.**

- A good representative experience to a Veteran is when the representative;

  - Completes and submits all paperwork

  - Gathers evidence needed to assist with the claim

  - Meets the Veteran where and when they want to meet

  - Keeps the Veteran up to date on claim statuses

  - Delivers on getting the Veteran more benefits

- Less commonly we heard Veterans defaulting to ‘VA assignment’ or using their local VSO chapter to get a representative.

- _Quotes/ Searching for Representative_

> _“Within a month of discharge they asked me to make an appointment at the closest VA hospital. With driving time, with traffic, it was about 2 hours each way. I was probably automatically assigned with the VSO available at that time.” - P1_

> _“Yes \[I explored online options], multiple times. Had issues. Tried to find ways to get VA assistance organizations. Tried to get them to come to our town. We had a Veteran’s roadshow where organizations came. We were able to get assistance from her \[a VSO]. Other Veterans said the same thing, even remotely you have to drive 4+ hours to start to get assistance. A lot of our Veterans are ambulatory and can’t drive safely, no vehicular assistance.” - P2_

> _“I've just been reaching out to all my connections through our old unit. We belong to an association. We got about 6,000 members. So I've kind of reached out and  have to sift through that, because, of course, everyone has kind of a different spin on who they think might be best. So I'm still somewhat anxious about trying to find that. I'm going to look online. My cousin, who is a marine, used an attorney in Texas. So I'm gonna talk with him as well this week. So yeah, that's where I'm at with that and the tools I'm using.” - P3_

> _“I mean, I'm a lifetime member of the DAV so this time I decided to use them.” - P6_

- _Quotes/ Good Representative Experiences_

 > _“I continue to work with them \[attorney] now. Hurry up and get the information in and then just wait wait wait. He did represent me at the appeals hearing. Before he did this one, he appealed another one and he had success with that. He’s just been really successful and good to work with.” - P4_

 > _“They \[DAV] gathers any of the evidence necessary as well as any interview process that's needed in support of the claim. They also advise you what evidence, medical evidence, into a personal statement you might need and to assist the claim. No, I'm extremely confident with the service I received from them as well as the follow up information to keep me advised of what's happening. The status of the claim and or the appeal. So I'm extremely pleased with the service I received from them.” - P8_

- _Quotes/ Bad Representative Experiences_

> _“When I moved to Arizona I was assigned American Legion. When I left the military I worked with them. When I moved to Arizona I found out in advance that DAV is stronger in Arizona and I’ve never been able to talk to them. When you call their number it’s always busy. So that's the situation with VSOs so far.” - P1_

 > _“It’s frustrating, working my patience. It’s been going on for quite some time now. Last year I got 40% approved and I haven’t heard anything back from her since they passed the PACT act so … A few months? Yes a few months.” - P7_


### Key Finding 3<a id="key-finding-3"></a>

**During the application process, and first meeting, most Veterans preferred in-person support from a representative to build trust and comfort with the process.**

- After the initial meeting and claim filing most Veterans were comfortable communicating on the phone or over virtual meetings, but still preferred in-person if possible.

- Why in-person? For some Veterans it was due to personal preference. Some wanted to be present for more complex tasks such as claim filings. Others it was due to the inability to get a hold of representatives over the phone causing lower trust. Seeing their representative in person increased their trust and comfort with the process.

- _\*Note: Some representatives have gone full remote during COVID, so Veterans looking for in-person support are unaware of the change and unable to get the support they need. Example includes Arizona Department of Veteran Services is full remote (_[__https://dvs.az.gov/services/benefits-page__](https://dvs.az.gov/services/benefits-page)_)._ 

- _Quotes/ Communication Preferences_

> _“I have called VSO numbers it’s um … you get put on hold and nobody ever comes on the line or it’s constantly busy … This is great. Rather than call, I'd just go to where they are.” - P1_

> _“I’m an in-person person, to finally meet her in person, she goes out of her way to help people, will travel and drive and everything else. She’s willing to do the work for you and will come back to you with questions. It’s been very nice. My first two conversations were in person, one in my town, one I went where she was, otherwise through phone and email.” - P2_

> _“People are less apt to lie to you, or swindle you, if they can look you in the eye, or you can look them in the eye.” - P7_

> _“I like one-on-one, talking directly to a person, but sometimes logistically, that's not possible. So a number of situations have been over the phone and or emails.” - P8_


### Key Finding 4<a id="key-finding-4"></a>

**Veterans continuously struggled with understanding representative terms and roles.**

- Veterans did not associate ‘accredited representative’ with representatives. Instead focusing on terms they knew such as VSO, service officer, or attorney. Analytics support this as VSO has three times the amount of search volume than representative on VA.gov (_see below_).

> _“I'm going to first want to know that a VSO and an accredited representative is the same thing, are they, or are they not? … I don't think they're the same thing. I think they're different.” - P5_

- Veterans were also confused about representative types and what they do, especially claims agents.

  - Claims agent: biggest source of confusion with half of Veterans never hearing of them, and others guessing they were scams or Veteran Service Officers.

  > _“I always thought a claims agent was a VSO, unless we’re talking about claim shark organizations, didn't realize they were separate. Didn’t realize they could charge. I’ll call them “claim sharks”. I thought it was talking about a VA claims agent. I’ve heard about them being predatory towards Veterans. I know dozens of Veterans who have used claim sharks, so they had to resort to paying these agencies to assist them with their claims. They were happy to finally get claims submitted and approved, but had to pay.” - P2_

  - VSO: Veterans were unsure if VSO is an organization or a person, but this did not stop them from completing the tasks.

  > _“So I'm thinking a VSO, Veteran Service Organization, is the same thing as a VSO, a Veteran Service Officer. In other words, is the VSO the person, or is the VSO the organization?” - P5_

    - One participant was unaware that VSOs could aid in filing their claim.

  > _“I always thought they were a place to go and drink beer!” - P7_

  - Attorney: No challenges.

### Key Finding 5<a id="key-finding-5"></a>

**While most Veterans had never considered VA.gov to find a representative, after seeing the experience every Veteran wanted to use it immediately.**

- Half of Veterans assumed VA.gov didn’t have representative information because it ‘never crossed their mind’.

  > _“I have not. Never crossed my mind. I guess I haven't drilled that far into it to see that that's something they recommend. Well now that you've mentioned it, I will probably go in there and look and see who they have in there.” - P6_

- Others had previously attempted to use VA.gov, but never got a successful answer. Those Veterans don’t use VA.gov for representative information anymore because of previous frustrations.

  > _“I tried my first two years and never got one successful answer. I stopped using it for that reason and went to other means. On VA.gov I haven’t tried in two plus years because of the frustration before. So I don’t use it out of frustration and I have an avenue now I’m working on.” - P2_

- After completing the tasks _all_ Veterans wanted access to the tool to find representatives in their area.

  > _“If they were vetted attorneys, I'd absolutely use it.” - P2_

  > _“I would definitely use this tool just to see what my options are in the in the area. My, my assumption is it'll give me representatives local.” - P6_

  > _“I think it's awesome. it's hard for me to see any or give any critique on it, because I think it's awesome what you guys are doing. And I didn't even know this was available. So it's … And right now I'm kind of in a like opening presents at Christmas. You know, this is this is great. I can't wait to dive into it.” - P7_


## Tasks and Conclusions<a id="tasks-and-conclusions"></a>

### Task 1 / Navigate to where you expect to learn more about representatives on VA.gov.<a id="task-1--navigate-to-where-you-expect-to-learn-more-about-representatives-on-vagov"></a>

1. No participant was able to find representative information on their first attempt.

   1. Half were able to find representative information on benefits, eBenefits, OGC, or VA.gov after multiple attempts.

   2. Half were unsuccessful in the task.

2. Half started by navigating through search, half started by scanning the homepage.

   1. If users couldn't find what they were looking for they tried search, disability, or gave up.

3. Why? Most were looking for mention of representative titles, such as; Veteran Service Officer, VSO near me, or disability claim attorney.

   1. None associated the terms ‘accredited’ or ‘representative’ with their task.

   > _“Oh boo. So I typed \[VSO near me] in and it brought up nothing related to VSO.” - P5_


### Task 2 / Veterans expectations on content and next steps from the accredited representative landing page.<a id="task-2--veterans-expectations-on-content-and-next-steps-from-the-accredited-representative-landing-page"></a>

1. Most Veterans had positive comments on the content shown and immediately noticed the green ‘Find an accredited representative’ link.

   >  _“The last page \[on VA.gov] I had to read everything to find something. Quickly I can zip down to what I need. It has the forms right there. I don’t have to go and look for it.” - P4_

   >  _“So how do I find an accredited representative? I have to see … \[Veteran begins reading page.] I would be drawn to click that green circle and the arrow.” - P1_

2. All Veterans were confused about representative types and what they do.

   1. Claims agent: biggest source of confusion with half of Veterans never hearing of them, and others guessing they were scams or Veteran Service Officers.

      >  _“I always thought a claims agent was a VSO, unless we’re talking about claim shark organizations, didn't realize they were separate. Didn’t realize they could charge. I’ll call them “claim sharks”. I thought it was talking about a VA claims agent. I’ve heard about them being predatory towards Veterans. I know dozens of Veterans who have used claim sharks, so they had to resort to paying these agencies to assist them with their claims. They were happy to finally get claims submitted and approved, but had to pay.” - P2_

   2. VSO: Veterans were unsure if VSO is an organization or a person, but this did not stop them from completing the task.

      >  _“So I'm thinking a VSO, Veteran Service Organization, is the same thing as a VSO, a Veteran Service Officer. In other words, is the VSO the person, or is the VSO the organization?” - P5_

      2. One participant was unaware that VSOs could aid in filing their claim.

         >  _“I always thought they were a place to go and drink beer!” - P7_

   3. Attorney: No challenges.

   4. Accredited representative: Veterans were unsure what accredited representatives had to do with VSOs, attorneys, and claims agents.

      >  _“I'm going to first want to know that a VSO and an accredited representative is the same thing, are they, or are they not? … I don't think they're the same thing. I think they're different.” - P5_

3. Half of Veterans had filed the 21-22 before, and would expect to print, sign, scan, and email the signed form to their representative to sign and submit.

   1. One user was confused on next steps in general, but had self submitted.

   2. One user wasn’t sure of the difference between digital upload options.

   >  _“So I already have a 21-22. Had to fill that out for the DAV last year. I'd go get a newer version of it. I'm sure the governments changed it within a year. Then I'd sign it, scan it, email it to the rep, and then they would probably submit it for me.” - P6_


### Task 3 / Veterans expectations on content and next steps from the Find a Representative (search) page.<a id="task-3--veterans-expectations-on-content-and-next-steps-from-the-find-a-representative-search-page"></a>

1. Most Veterans liked the option to search by location and preferred having a local representative.

   >  _“I'd like to find somebody within 25-30 miles. I don't think that'd be an issue being that there's a large Air Force base just 15 miles from me and lots of retirees.” - P6_

   2. Participants in rural areas were looking for ways to expand the search radius.

2. Continued confusion on representative types, and users missed the informational dropdown.

   1. One Veteran assumed local VSOs would be omitted from the list because it calls for organizations, not officers.

      >  _“I think if you just put down organization, I would guess that's eliminating all of local VSOs in the communities. I think organization implies a specific title, be it the VFW, American Legion, Jewish War Veterans, whatever.” - P8_

3. Veterans did not mention pressure to pay for representation, but did mention they’d consider it if they were at a point they are considering alternatives to VSOs.

   >  _“No, I look at it like I can only take this so far and certainly in 2016 I found that I didn’t put in enough information to convey the situation. I would rather have 80% of something than 100% of nothing.” - P4_


### Task 4 / Veterans feedback on Find a Representative search results.<a id="task-4--veterans-feedback-on-find-a-representative-search-results"></a>

1. Most Veterans were happy with the search results presented and liked that the closest representatives were shown first.

   >  _“I have called VSO numbers. You get put on hold and nobody ever comes on the line or it’s constantly busy. This is great. Rather than call, I'd just go to where they are.” - P1_

2. Some Veterans expected the address to be clickable and open their native map application rather than having a Google Map link.

3. The most commonly requested missing search result information was;

   1. Rating system to make an informed decision on representative quality, either from Veteran peers or VA.

   2. Website to confirm accurate contact information.

   3. Representative capacity to know if the representative will have time to support them.

   4. Some notable mentions included;

      1. Service area for those in more rural areas.

      2. Case specializations for attorneys.

4. Most Veterans did not need to sort by ‘farthest to closest’. No other feedback on sort options.


### Task 5 / Navigate to where you expect to find your assigned representative on VA.gov.<a id="task-5--navigate-to-where-you-expect-to-find-your-assigned-representative-on-vagov"></a>

1. Most Veterans expected to find their representative in MyVA with their claim or decision review.

   1. Why? Veterans associated their claim with their representative and wanted to see their information inline.

      >  _“I'm sure you know who your representative is, or the contact information, in case you need em, it would be good to have there all in one spot, you know.” - P7_

   2. Or expected their representative in their profile since they’re assigned to them.


## Additional Insights<a id="additional-insights"></a>

1. **Every Veteran we spoke to used VA.gov to check statuses and updates with their claims and healthcare portals to keep up to date without having to call VA.**

> _“\[I sign in] several times a day … To look up to see what my claims are. I use it to double check my appointments. I have two or three VA appointments a week. I keep up with that in advance. I have appointments this week and they rescheduled. Because I live 45 minutes away, sometimes It takes an hour to get there because of the traffic. I use it to claim for travel reimbursement. They pay me for travel. I order my pharmaceuticals through there. I use it pretty extensively, especially when you have a claim in.” - P1_

> _“So I’m checking it every other day now just to see if there’s updates. Normally, I still go in there about once a week because I check the updates for the claims, I check the health and my prescriptions. And I’ve used it for other things as well.” - P4_

2. **Eroded trust is a continued theme with this audience, and impacts their adoption of tools and materials. Only by providing reliable and vetted tools can we maintain and build trust.**

> _“It’s not easy. The VA wants to help you after the last 5 years they want to help you but they don’t make it easy. It’s almost like fighting against the system.” - P1_

> _“Links have often not worked on the VA website. Page not displayed, times out, whatever else, or I have to sign in again, sign in again, sign in again, and it doesn’t work.” - P2_

> _“No, I’m assuming it does not have that functionality. And if it did, I don’t know that I would trust it. The very ones spending billions to ensure they don’t pay people – I don’t think I’d accept their help in finding someone to help me.  I don’t trust the VA. I don’t trust them to provide me with that service.” - P3_


## Recommendations<a id="recommendations"></a>

The following recommendations support these business objectives and desired outcomes:

### Business Objectives<a id="business-objectives"></a>
1. Veterans start moving away from legacy processes for finding a representative, in favor of our solution on VA.gov.
2. Veterans are able to successfully find a representative through our Find a Representative tool.

### Desired Business Outcomes<a id="desired-business-outcomes"></a>

1. Increase the functionality of VA.gov to support searching for accredited representatives.
2. Reduce the time it takes for Veterans to find an accredited representative.
3. Expedite the deprecation of the legacy eBenefits platform by delivering replacement services.


### Mission Critical Recommendations<a id="mission-critical"></a>

1. Improve findability of the Find a Representative tool through homepage placement and keyword improvements. Not doing so could directly impact KPI performance. (Key Finding 4 & 5, Task 1)

2. Replace ‘accredited representative’ with more Veteran facing terms such as VSO, Veteran Service Officer, Veteran Service Organization, or attorney. Not doing so directly impacts findability and Veteran understanding. (Key Finding 4, Tasks 1, 2, 3)

   1. Technical considerations: This will affect our breadcrumbs and headers (small change).

3. Improve representative data quality to increase adoption and trust in information. (Key Finding 5, Additional Finding 2)

   1. Technical considerations: Report option and transparency of data, would like to see design recommendations before beginning development.

4. Consider turning ON Veteran Service Officers to bring local VSO locations to search. While turning OFF Veteran Service Organizations and Claims Agents for MVP. Veteran Service Organizations as they only show national headquarters which are less relevant to location based search. Claims agents due to lower data quality, search terms, and understanding from Veterans of any group. (Key Finding 2, 3, 4, Task 2, 3)

   1. Technical considerations:

      1. 2 weeks estimate for supporting Veteran Service Officers.

      2. Small update to the back end to stop supporting requests that are for the Claims Agents and Organization type.

      3. Small update to remove Organization from the frontend. 

      4. Would like design input on if the search results for Officers should be handled differently.


### Recommend for Next Version<a id="recommend-for-next-version"></a>

5. Make the ‘How can each type of representative help me?’ more prominent on the Find a Representative tool. (Task 3)

   1. Technical consideration: Small task, just need design guidance.

6. Provide a search radius option for Veterans in more rural areas. (Tasks 3 & 4)

   1. Technical considerations:

      1. 1 days’ worth of work to update the backend to take in different radius selections.

      2. 1 days’ worth of work to implement a design pattern for radius selection (thinking a drop down); would like to define design before diving in.

7. Remove the sort option ‘farthest to closest’. (Task 4)

   1. Technical considerations: 1 days’ worth of work (or less) for front and back end.

8. _(Nice to have)_ Make the address clickable from the search results and open in the users native map application. (Task 4)

   1. Technical considerations: Requires technical research to define the implementation.


### Cross Team Collaboration Opportunities<a id="cross-team-collaboration-opportunities"></a>

9. Provide inputs for representatives to mark and display if they are remote only, and to turn off private addresses. (Key Finding 3, Task 3)

   1. Technical considerations: Back end will need a new attribute that is sent to the front end, and front end will need to receive and react to that.  Small tasks for both.

10. Give Veterans a way to fill-out and sign the 21-22/21-22a and send to their representative to sign and submit in a secure manner. (Task 2)

    1. Technical considerations: Unsure, will inquire with Kayce White on how other forms manage the signature piece.

11. Place assigned representative associated with the Veterans claim on MyVA, or under the Veterans profile. (Task 5)

    1. Technical considerations: Will need to partner with other teams to define how to work together. Example; can ARM implement and they review, or do we rely on them to do this when they have time/priority available?

12. _(Nice to have)_ Additional data points to consider for search results; Veteran reviews or ratings, websites, capacity, service area, or case specialization (attorneys only).

    1. Technical considerations: Can add this information to existing or new tables on the backend, front end will react.  Small tasks for both.
