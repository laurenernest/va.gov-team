## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
User flow can be found at this [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1701808829216/178998265b5996341a48a0b7c499292188b223fb?sender=ua67f17f1c416a96ea04d2476)

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
We're currently thinking that we should have a Resources and Support (R+S) page for max schedular rating info that we can link to from within the 526 form flow, and also in other places on va.gov
![resources and support page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/6ecec450-505a-4c11-b30f-17e4c29407b3)


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
URLs and breadcrumbs are auto-generated when creating a R+S page, so we don't need to delineate these. 


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
We could consider linking to the new R+S page about max schedular rating from the following places where veterans might wonder about their ratings.

1. Decision Letter - we could consider adding info on max CFI to the decision letter itself, so that users learn about max schedular ratings when they've received one. I'm not sure how we operationalize that or who is responsible for those changes.
2. [Types of disability claims and when to file](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/)
3. [The VA claim process after you file](https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/)
4. [About VA disability ratings](https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/)
5. [What to expect after you get a rating](https://www.va.gov/disability/about-disability-ratings/after-you-get-a-rating/)
6. View your VA disability ratings (authenticated page) -- the team would like to add info about max schedular rating here, but not for the MVP.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
None needed

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets <br>
Probably not needed, but we could consider adding one if we decide to do the R+S page.
