# IA Design for Form 20-10207
**STATUS: In Progress**

**Team:** Veteran facing forms

**IA Request:** [Link to Sitewide Content and IA intake request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/67851)

**On this page:**
- [User/page flows](#flows)
- [Page structure](#map)
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Best Bets](#bestbets)
- [Staged Rollout](#stagedrollout)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL:
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > Supporting forms for VA claims > H1 of form page
- Notes: Subsequent pages will add on to the above URL using short and simple labels, i.e. .../introduction/. We can provide further guidance on these additions if needed.

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*


1. **[Supporting forms page](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label: 
  - Link destination: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Notes: 

2. **Online Form 21-526EZ** - Modify
  - Placement description:
  - Link label:
  - Link destination: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Disability team and are in conversation on how to implement this form into the online 21-526ez form. If there's any additional support needed here in regards to the 21-526ezform flow and where to place this form, we would definitely be interested in sharing any feedback or answer any questions. We've discussed how this could look and we've thought maybe adding at the end of the flow so folks aren't sent through another form flow in the middle of another, but would love to hear y'alls thoughts on this and other ideas.

3. **Online Form 21P-527EZ** - Modify
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label:
  - Link destination: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Notes: This is another form that is already digitized that we believe it could be helpful to mention priority processing in the pension form flow. The pension form will be reactivated soon and so I definitely suggest connecting with the team as they begin working on the next version.

4. **[VA Survivors Pension](https://www.va.gov/pension/survivors-pension/)** - Add
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: 
  - Notes: This form isn't currently digitized, but this is another that we suggest working with that designated team to see if priority processing can be added to the form flow. For now, we suggest adding it to the landing page under "How long does it take VA to make a decision?"

5. **Claim Status Tool** - Add
  - Placement description: 
  - Link label:
  - Link destination: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Notes: I know the team has already connected with the Benefits Management team as well. We've added a suggestion for the entry point to be the logged-in landing page for the tool, but would be interested to hear that team's feedback or any questions on that suggestion. Happy to revisit this proposed entry point!

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*  

No redirect recommendations!

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

No best bets!

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
