| Decision | Date | Owner | Who was involved |
| --------| ------| -----| ---------|
| Design system team will not make any production changes. They will determine work then require Flagship App (Health/Global) to make the changes in production at which time QA will test | 12/7/23 | Kelly & Adam | Kelly, Adam, Stacy during Shared System Huddle |
| Design System will proactive inform QA when planning if and when they need testing. Given the above decision PM wants to limit excess QA time spent on teams without QA. Kelly to reach out to Rachael when needed | 12/7/23 | Kelly & Adam | Kelly, Adam, Stacy during Shared System Huddle |
| Q1 planning, Adam will be the QA Agent for APIs, Rachel for Design System, Tom for Health and Benefits, Therese for Global, none for Veteran Status | 11/27/23 | QA team | Tim, Rachael, Therese, Tom |
| Q4 work, Rachel QA agent for Design System, API and floater ; Tom for Health and Benefits & release testing, Therese for Global, none for Veteran Status. Determined with Tim Wright's approval | 11/27/23 | QA team | Tim, Rachael, Therese, Tom |
| Seth Eheart confirmed that there is no QA / Release or Health / Benefits team capacity needed to support this team at this time. Tim thought that VS will go through Flagship App Health and Benefits but that is not what Seth had communicated. Given his there is no planned QA work to support Veteran Status team for their work or any future releases until Mobile Leadership provides change communication and clarification.

| Adam / Binny agreed to add in an analytical event to the release code after the release branch was cut. Analytics is not tested by QA and given some upstream struggles from the engineering team this analytics it should have been in but was not. Analytics needed to help identify errors which could be done sooner than if delayed till next release. Given not tested by Analytics then no additional action needed by QA for testing.  | 12/7/23 | Adam | Adam / Binny |
