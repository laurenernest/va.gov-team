# Call Center Documentation

## Purpose:
 * Call Center Guide needs to stay updated with any production Veteran facing changes that are made in the Mobile app
 * Mobile will need to make relevant updates to the guide for their changes and follow the Call CEnter process to get it updated 

## Owner: 
 * PM of the teams that are making Production changes

## Other Info:
 * Assess what needs to be done for the call center
     * Call CEnter Guide
     * Meeting with them / demo
 * Content used to handle this but it transitioned to PM ownership with Program Leadership approval early 2023
 * Needs to be done before the release so the Call Center gets the update before the Veterans do
 * Should be submitted no later than 5 business days before launch day, if no response in 5 days you will need to reach out to Contact Center POC
    * HRC POC:  Brenda Torres-Hill (brenda.torres-hill@va.gov) 

## Process: 
* Download the [In Use Mobile Product Guide from Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/releases/Call%20Center%20Docs/In%20use%20version0)
* Modify it accordingly and update the change management
* Be sure to look to see if other areas in the document need to be updated
   * Example if its a component, navigation, style change then likely multiple images / content needs to be changed 
* Once the Product Guide is completely updated see [Veteran Support/ Contact Center document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/contact-center/request-contact-center-review.md) for direction on how to proceed 
   * Example [32766 ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32766)
* Remove the old version in [In Use Mobile Product Guide from Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/releases/Call%20Center%20Docs/In%20use%20version0) and replace it with the new one you submitted
