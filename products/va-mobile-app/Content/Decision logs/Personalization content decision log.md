# VA: Health & Benefits mobile app content decision log
We started this decision log as of December 2023. We'll continue to update content decisions moving forward. We'll also fill in any decisions that were made pre-December 2023 as we can.

We broke out the decision log based on feature -- as a opposed to a continuous log of all content decision across the entire mobile app -- for easier access/scanability.

| 12/08/2023 | Descriptive word for message count on Home screen | Unread | I explored both "new" and "unread". And confirmed that what is determining the message count is whether a Veteran has tapped into a message. This means an "older" message could still be unread. "Unread" could also help remind a Veteran who forgot to read an older message. Like, "Hey the Home screen is telling me a still have an unread message even though I've read the ones that showed up on top. Let me go check. [actually scrolls] Well, looky there! There's one I missed." I chatted with Laura W. from CAIA about how the web Medications team is framing this. She thought either choice was fine and that it likely wouldn't trip users up if we used new or unread. But the Medications web tool is using unread. Finally, since we're not using this space on the Home screen as a notifications area (and more of grouping of "active" items," I'd like to save the word "new" for when we. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Laura Willwerth |
| 12/08/2023 | Content to show in new Accouncements area on personalized Home screen | VAHB mobile app will mirror announcments/update on unauthenticated VA.gov home screen | We needed to determine not only what will go in our new Accouncements section for MVP but in the future as well. The MVP suggestion is to link to PACT Act info. But what do we show when that is no longer relevant? My recommendation is to follow the main announcement/updates component on the VA.gov landing screen. Per Danielle Thierry, that area has been an OPIA (Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs)-driven area. Its intention is to _highlight high-profile benefit and health-related updates for Veterans_. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 
| 12/07/2023 | Keep or get rid of COVID-19 updates | Delete COVID-19 updates from new Personalized Home screen as well as Health category screen | VA.gov has buried this COVID-19 updates page. I had to do a literal search to find the page. It's not highlighted on their Home or health-related screens.

| 12/07/2023 | Descriptive word for claims count on Home screen | Active | This is the current word used to descriptive claims and appeals that aren't closed (i.e., open) on both mobile app and web. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 
| 12/06/2023 | Greeting on Home screen | Welcome, [preferred name] (on first sign in) Welcome back, [preferred name] (on subsequent sign ins) | We did some exploration of greeting options, trying to balance a personal experience with VA's voice and tone. After discussing with Danielle, we agreed to Welcome for first sign in and Welcome back for all subsequent sign ins. | Misty Milliron-Grant (with help from Danielle Thierry)
