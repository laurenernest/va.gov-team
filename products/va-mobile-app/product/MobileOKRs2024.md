Mobile Platform

Mission: Build the foundations for VA's digital stability and enable teams to build experiences with confidence, faster and more efficiently than everyone else. 
Stability: Enable teams to build with confidence
Productivity: Enable teams to build faster
Efficiency: Enable teams to build more with less

Objective 1: Stability: Enable teams to build with confidence.
Experience teams delivering changes fast and often is only half of the picture. Stability is enabling Experience teams to make changes confidently, without breaking the end user’s experience. We provide reliable services and consult Experience teams with guardrails and best practices.

KRs:

1. Change failure rate, e.g. hotfixes, rollbacks, etc.
2. Number of incidents, incidence by severity, etc.
3. Mean time to repair, e.g. time to detect, time to repair, etc.
4. App load time
5. Uptime and error rate


Objective 2: Productivity: Enable teams to build faster
Same input, more output.
Note: Emphasis on teams. Here, productivity is not a measure of individual performance.

KRs:
1.Lead time, the time between code change and release, is shorter. 
e.g. Continuous Integration (CI) duration, PR review time, deployment time
2. Deployment frequency, friction before code change, gets reduced. 
•Onboarding, e.g. time to 1st PR, time to 10th PR, time to first impactful PR
•Documentation, e.g. time to find documentation, documentation rating
•Focus, e.g. context switching per task
3. Platform user/developer happiness trends in positive direction.

Objective 3:
Efficiency: Enable teams to build more with less
Less input, more output.
1.Cloud cost
2.Off the shelf tools cost
3.Platform + Experience Teams cost
  - velocity
  - platform and experience team people ratio

Next steps: Each mobile platform team to develop team-level, quarter-level OKRs. First Quarter OKRs due in January, during quarterly planning.
